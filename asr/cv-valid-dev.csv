BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER,00:00:05.06
THEN WHY SHOULD THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY SEE ONE,00:00:03.58
A YOUNG ARAB ALSO LOADED DOWN WITH BAGGAGE ENTERED AND GREETED THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:05.98
I FELT THAT EVERYTHING I OWNED WOULD BE DESTROYED,00:00:04.46
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:04.54
BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED,00:00:02.14
ARE YOU SURE DIS IS CLAIRE,00:00:03.14
IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL,00:00:03.34
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS,00:00:05.62
THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT HE TAUGHT HIMSELF ALL HE COULD,00:00:05.14
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME,00:00:04.46
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET,00:00:02.88
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:04.73
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY,00:00:04.92
WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT,00:00:05.30
GOT ANYTHING YOUONLY HANGING,00:00:02.06
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO TELL VINCENT,00:00:05.18
ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL,00:00:05.50
TO ROURISH THE FALCON,00:00:02.76
THEES CONVENTION'S GOING TO COST PLENTY,00:00:03.34
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC,00:00:04.63
NEXT IN STELL AN EXTENSION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ADD CUSTOM FIGHT AND COMMANDS,00:00:06.96
THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCONIST,00:00:03.50
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF DE SODIAC TO HER,00:00:10.08
THOUGH YOU WON'T BLAME HER,00:00:02.52
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU CREATED THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BOY ANSWERED,00:00:08.47
DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN,00:00:02.16
HE HAD SEEN THIS SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY,00:00:09.38
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA,00:00:03.38
A GINTO THROW A ROCK,00:00:02.18
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY,00:00:09.02
MIGHT TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PRAMS,00:00:04.20
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:03.29
I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER,00:00:06.98
I WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH,00:00:04.78
IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED,00:00:03.50
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND SHE HAS URGED ME TO DO THE SAME,00:00:06.50
MINES IN THE DOOR,00:00:03.86
FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN SEE THE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES,00:00:04.08
YOU MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID IN CONTAST WITH KHIVS,00:00:11.54
OGOLVI WATCHED TILL ON AND THEN GAVE UP,00:00:05.57
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO,00:00:02.64
HIS SPEECH ENDED IN STANDING OVATION,00:00:03.29
IN HER WAY SO AM I HE SAID,00:00:02.98
WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MAN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THE ARMSH TO ME,00:00:05.76
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND,00:00:05.18
WE MUST BE GOOD,00:00:01.94
HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TEN ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO,00:00:05.78
NOT EVEN THE TRIBEL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO,00:00:06.74
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME,00:00:01.94
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY,00:00:02.02
OUR GENERATOR HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY ULTRAHIGH FREQUENCY WAVES,00:00:04.27
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WALL,00:00:05.64
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH,00:00:03.05
THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING,00:00:02.86
NO ONE ATTACKS AN OASIS,00:00:02.40
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT,00:00:02.74
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND OBLL ET TOUCHED YOU IF YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR,00:00:09.65
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER,00:00:04.01
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE,00:00:02.86
EXCUSE YOU FOR WHAT,00:00:02.69
YESTERDAY I WAITED FOREVER FOR THE SUBWAY TRAIN,00:00:03.98
I'LL GO RIGHT AFTER IT,00:00:02.95
JUST MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME,00:00:03.70
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT OMONDS,00:00:02.42
WHERE WAS HIS HORSE,00:00:01.42
IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND,00:00:03.14
COMPILING THE LINNOX COLONEL CAN BE TIME CONSUMING,00:00:04.20
IF THAT GUY LAYS AN EGG,00:00:02.52
THE BRASS LAMD HAD BEEN DISTURBED,00:00:04.70
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN,00:00:05.30
WHO DO YOU THINK WRITES THEM,00:00:02.90
ANARCHY OF UDOCHY ABOUT IT,00:00:02.81
THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ORE FAR BEHIND THE STATE OF THE ART IN IMAGE LUSIFICATION,00:00:04.27
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE,00:00:01.94
JUDGE DEBORA SENT ME,00:00:02.18
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:05.42
IT LEFT A GREENY STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS,00:00:04.66
THE HOMELESS SEEMED TO LIKE SOUP,00:00:02.86
AND FINALLY THE FALCON RETURNED WITH THEIR MEAL,00:00:04.22
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHOUT BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP,00:00:05.06
HE DECONTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD,00:00:07.58
AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS,00:00:04.06
LOOK AT THE POLICY I GAVE HIM,00:00:04.10
THEN I DON'T GET PAID,00:00:02.62
I GOT TWO GIANT BULKBITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT,00:00:05.42
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING,00:00:02.83
AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY,00:00:03.41
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE,00:00:04.18
THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED IT THE ANSWER,00:00:03.02
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE THEM WITH,00:00:04.82
WHAT A BOSS ALL THAT,00:00:03.22
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT,00:00:03.17
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND,00:00:06.91
WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US,00:00:02.69
YOU ARE FAR TOO VALLABLE,00:00:03.05
THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DON'T REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE,00:00:08.64
A HALF OF HELOT,00:00:01.42
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM,00:00:04.66
IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DRINK AT LEAST TWO LEADERS OF WATER A DAY,00:00:04.13
VIBRATIONS OF PEASE TELE COTENT,00:00:03.79
THOMAS WENT TO WAR,00:00:03.38
THEY WERE IN AN IMMENSE SETTING SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPEAKING A STRANGE LANGUAGE,00:00:05.69
TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA,00:00:03.91
I'LL HANG IT UP,00:00:04.58
THERE IS A WAY OUT,00:00:03.50
I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID,00:00:06.67
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED,00:00:04.94
I'LL TERL YOU IN A MINUTE,00:00:02.47
I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT,00:00:04.42
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH A SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES,00:00:06.26
THAT'S WHY I WAS SENT DOWN HERE,00:00:03.74
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:04.85
HE HAD COME TO A TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM,00:00:03.58
WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:07.30
FOR SOME REASON WE WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING,00:00:02.54
THE THREAMING POOL WAS FULL OF CHLOREN,00:00:06.96
BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT,00:00:03.14
HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD,00:00:07.34
SHERI FAILED HER VASAL AND LAUGHED,00:00:02.74
I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED,00:00:05.28
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE BUILD BEYOND THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES,00:00:07.34
AT OTHER TIMES AT A CRUISING MOMENT YOU MAKE IT EASIER FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN,00:00:05.30
ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED,00:00:05.98
YOU CAN'T DESERT NOW,00:00:02.42
I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES,00:00:05.98
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME,00:00:02.78
THEY'VE ARRACED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:05.21
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPETER,00:00:05.09
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NUS,00:00:03.29
USING SCRIP LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT,00:00:04.90
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SENSE I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER,00:00:06.77
HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER,00:00:02.18
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STANDARD DEVIATION,00:00:02.74
NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH,00:00:01.61
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,00:00:04.01
THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS,00:00:02.52
FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SAY SCORE TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD OR CAMEL TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD,00:00:09.22
I AM A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE,00:00:05.18
WE WANT TO SELL HENMADE CHUKA BOOTS IN THAT FOOD TRUOK,00:00:03.12
HE IS TALKING LIKE A CHILD,00:00:02.42
THE QUICKER THE BETTER,00:00:02.30
THEN YOU MARRIED HER,00:00:02.18
FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY,00:00:03.38
THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP,00:00:04.42
FEW PEOPLE REALIZED THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY,00:00:03.50
WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME,00:00:05.30
ITS LAURA END WAS STILL IMBEDDED,00:00:02.42
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TROWED BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YE HAD TO SET OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR,00:00:09.14
NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB,00:00:04.56
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND T,00:00:03.17
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:05.42
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED,00:00:02.76
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED,00:00:04.70
I'M HUNTING WITH MAFOLCAN THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.30
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MAN'S MOUTH THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:06.58
AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID,00:00:02.57
SO YOU KNOW ABOU LUP THE BOY SAID,00:00:02.74
THERE ARE RUMORS OF TRIVAL WARS HE TOLD THEM,00:00:03.82
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:05.76
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED AND THE LIGHT OF THE MOON,00:00:03.14
THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE,00:00:03.22
HE ONLY LOST THREE BUTTONS OFF HIS VEST,00:00:04.42
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS,00:00:04.13
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY,00:00:04.06
HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE SENTRIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT,00:00:04.63
FADI MAN NE GORITY ABURNING HER EYES,00:00:04.87
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED,00:00:02.18
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE,00:00:07.10
NOHT LOBINY DID,00:00:02.50
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST,00:00:03.72
FEW PEOPLE REALIZED THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY,00:00:04.42
ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY,00:00:03.94
YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN,00:00:03.48
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HAD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HIRED AWAY,00:00:05.50
WHAT BOAT ARE YOU SAILING ON,00:00:02.30
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:05.18
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ELENOR,00:00:02.50
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:03.12
WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKETE,00:00:03.38
WHAT A LOAD OF TRESH SARAH A PIND,00:00:03.70
REST WELL TO NIGHT AS IF YOU WERE A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR COMBAT,00:00:05.11
THE TEAN AGRS PUT ON RED HOODIES FOR THEIR ANNUAL TO BAGENRAM,00:00:04.10
LEARNED TO RECOGNISE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID,00:00:05.42
BURLING CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR,00:00:03.62
LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MAP,00:00:03.00
THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT ITS DESTINY TO THE END,00:00:05.21
THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM,00:00:04.10
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:06.07
CRUKS DON'T PAY TEXAS,00:00:02.90
THE OMENS TOLD HIM SO,00:00:02.50
BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FADAMER,00:00:03.22
THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD,00:00:05.30
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EY WAS TIRED,00:00:04.56
WELCOME TO DAVE'S GUITAR SESSION,00:00:04.70
IS THAT DOP STILL OPEN,00:00:02.69
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TO,00:00:04.54
HE BELIEVED IN ALMENDS,00:00:04.25
ON TOP OF ALL THAT THE WEEDS KEEP GROWING AND THE GABBIT HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT,00:00:05.86
BOUGHT A LOVELY JAP,00:00:02.62
AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS,00:00:06.10
THAT'S NOT SO BAD,00:00:02.83
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY,00:00:03.79
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY,00:00:06.50
FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECIVE A PIECE OF GOLD,00:00:06.46
AND EVENTUALLY MAN WOOL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WOLL WANT AGAIN FLOURISH,00:00:08.45
THE OCHYMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS,00:00:05.83
WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT,00:00:05.81
ANY DECENT EDITOR CAN SHOW YOU Y NUMBERS AND LET YOU JUMP TO SPECIFIC WAI,00:00:05.18
I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING,00:00:05.38
IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOGS,00:00:11.18
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT,00:00:03.10
MAYBE TO MORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY,00:00:03.98
I WANT MY GARDEN TO BE FILLED WITH ROSES PETUNIAS AND PASSION FLOWERS,00:00:05.57
AND WE HAD A BINT,00:00:02.30
MISTER AND MISSUS NATE JOINED THE RED CROSS AND SEWED,00:00:05.18
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES,00:00:05.14
JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU,00:00:02.78
THE MORDO HAS EFFECTUALLY THREE FULLY CONNECTED LAARS,00:00:05.02
HE SAW THAT FATIMA'S EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS,00:00:07.34
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY,00:00:05.35
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY,00:00:03.50
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS,00:00:04.70
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON,00:00:04.61
IT WAS VERY HALF A HAD O POCUTS,00:00:02.74
DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY,00:00:05.74
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES,00:00:03.02
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:04.56
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF HOT DESERT,00:00:04.44
MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE,00:00:02.74
THE SHOP WAS CLOSED ON MONDAY,00:00:02.66
HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE,00:00:04.37
LET'S HAVE YOUR STORY,00:00:02.30
IT WAS A BANDLE OF MONEY,00:00:02.06
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS,00:00:05.06
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED,00:00:01.82
IF YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT RECURSION IS READ THIS SENTENCE AGAIN,00:00:05.52
THE FHIEF WAS IN THERE THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA,00:00:04.34
THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED,00:00:05.21
THE MON WAS IRRITATED,00:00:02.78
A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHALL NEVER FORGET ABOUT A SHEEP,00:00:04.58
IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW,00:00:03.10
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMD TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER,00:00:04.22
CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE,00:00:06.34
THE BOY TRIED TO READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE SAND,00:00:03.36
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME,00:00:02.86
HE STUCK HIS HAND INTO THE POACH AND FELT AROUND FOR ONE OF THE STONES,00:00:04.18
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES,00:00:06.58
AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT IS TO SAY IN PUTS,00:00:06.22
YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED,00:00:06.62
WHERE SHE USED TO LIVE,00:00:02.30
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS,00:00:03.53
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO,00:00:04.63
HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DON AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS,00:00:06.58
I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE,00:00:02.14
THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS,00:00:02.50
WHO IS YOUR FRIENND THE TRUTH ASKED,00:00:05.42
THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SKETTERED PINE TREE,00:00:04.42
BEFORE GONS WARIN VAINTED ARMIS HID TO THROW BULLER SAIN HIS SHOULDER AND IF A BULLET PLUSHED YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO SEEK OUT UNDER WENIS FOR,00:00:08.81
MY SEVEN YEAR ESU MAY AP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS,00:00:05.38
THEY PLAYED UETS TOGETHER,00:00:03.70
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTISED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED,00:00:05.09
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,00:00:01.82
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPELAT FIRST,00:00:05.42
WELL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AND EAT THESE HAWKS,00:00:04.54
THE ORANGE FRUIT IS NOT YET RIPENED,00:00:03.50
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT,00:00:02.98
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID,00:00:03.05
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN LEATHERLING,00:00:04.54
THE OLD MAN WORE A BREAST BLADE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST,00:00:04.78
IN AS A TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:03.58
THE FIRST BASEMAN DROPPED THE BALL,00:00:02.86
HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN RIMID WERE,00:00:05.42
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION,00:00:08.38
IS IT FOR FURTHER AUTOMATIC PROCESSING,00:00:04.18
ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL,00:00:03.38
FROM THEN ON THE BOY ANDERSET HIS HEART,00:00:04.10
OF COURSE HE'S COMING BACK HERE,00:00:02.74
THEY ARE JUST A PILE OF STONES,00:00:03.34
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME,00:00:03.55
THEN WHO ARE YOU,00:00:02.42
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY,00:00:03.10
THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATREES AND INNUMERABLE GORTAN SPREAD IN ONE CAN,00:00:07.46
OH BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE,00:00:02.30
THE PEAK OF THUS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL,00:00:03.98
THE BOY WATCHED THE EXCHANGE WITH FASCINATION,00:00:03.91
IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION  JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS MON ES IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME,00:00:08.54
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING,00:00:02.66
MY HONIS ATE,00:00:02.38
HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE,00:00:04.44
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART,00:00:02.06
I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE,00:00:02.93
BE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER,00:00:02.02
OUR CLOTHES ARE DRY,00:00:01.94
THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNS ALL THINGS HE SAID,00:00:03.22
THE INVADERS CARRIED THE LAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE,00:00:06.70
THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY,00:00:04.42
A PART OF ME IS ALSO TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH ANY MORE,00:00:09.07
WHAT DID I TELL YOU,00:00:01.92
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN,00:00:05.38
HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES,00:00:07.94
A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES,00:00:03.89
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH,00:00:03.43
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE,00:00:03.77
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING,00:00:05.14
THE HALF THE SHUG COLLUPS,00:00:01.75
SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK,00:00:04.82
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM,00:00:03.38
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY,00:00:05.14
I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.94
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS ERENLY NOT VERY EXITING,00:00:04.03
WHAT'S THIS THE END OF THE EIGHT,00:00:02.35
AND THERE WERE GUNE'S ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE A SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE,00:00:07.25
BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW ITS DREAMS AND WISHES AND WILL KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM,00:00:05.38
I HAVE DISABLED SOME OF THE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES BUT THEY ARE NOT GREAT OUT IN THIS LIST,00:00:06.29
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US,00:00:03.58
YOU TOLD ME THAT,00:00:03.31
I'M GOING TO MISS ANNIE,00:00:02.69
HE PUT HIS HEAD CLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF COMEL SKIN,00:00:05.06
AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER,00:00:05.18
WE ARE HAVING HABRUGUS,00:00:02.18
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED,00:00:04.56
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.82
THE SEA HAS LIVED ON IN THE SHELL BECAUSE THAT'S ITS DESTINY,00:00:05.59
MOIST SOIL IS GOOD FOR THE FLORA,00:00:02.86
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS YOUR DADASET AND THAT IT IS NIL,00:00:05.66
NOBODY'S GOING TO RUSH ME INTO ANYTHING,00:00:03.74
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS,00:00:07.58
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED,00:00:06.89
JUST WHAT IS TE LOW DOWN ON WILLIAMS,00:00:01.94
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THET'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHYMIST,00:00:04.66
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METYA WRIGHTS STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES,00:00:07.03
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT,00:00:01.90
WON DAT THAT GET US,00:00:01.66
THE NIGHT WAS WONG AND I WAS THIRSTY,00:00:05.26
LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED,00:00:04.34
ONE NIGHT THE FATHER HAD A DREAM,00:00:03.38
IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING,00:00:02.26
I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS ONE UP,00:00:02.38
HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO,00:00:04.25
LET ME CARM YOUR HAIR,00:00:01.54
SOMETIMES SAILS CHARLES NORVAY TO HOLD BACG SERIMO,00:00:05.21
THERE WILL BE NO RED UPRISING,00:00:02.33
HER HEIGHT HELPED HER WITH HER FIGHTING,00:00:03.29
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOR SHEEP,00:00:07.30
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL,00:00:03.26
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE,00:00:02.98
GIRTS ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER VIEW,00:00:02.54
WE ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THAT RIGHT NOW,00:00:03.34
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,00:00:02.54
I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS,00:00:05.59
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION,00:00:07.58
HOW LONG IS IT,00:00:02.45
BUT MY HEART IS AGITATED THE VOICE,00:00:03.26
I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN,00:00:05.38
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND,00:00:06.58
WHERE YOU GOT HIM,00:00:01.22
THEN I DON'T GET PAID,00:00:03.50
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID,00:00:05.95
HIS NEW FRIEND PUSHED THE OWNERS ASIDE AND PULLED THE BOY OUTSIDE WITH HIM,00:00:04.34
WHERE IS THE OLD GOLD,00:00:01.92
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME,00:00:06.65
MY NAME IS MELCHUSEDEK SAID THE OLD MAN,00:00:05.18
THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD,00:00:08.38
THEN SUPPOSE YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY,00:00:03.05
SHE FEDIT ON THE SHALF AND DEISTATE,00:00:04.13
SHE LIKES YOU WELL ENOUGH TO STICK AROU,00:00:02.42
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY,00:00:07.03
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.98
OUR HEART ARE PECULAR HAMMITON FROM THE PIT,00:00:03.26
IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUE LOVE,00:00:06.00
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:03.50
THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND,00:00:03.36
ASKS ONOR OF DATSTON HOW MUCH IS WHAT GOES HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND,00:00:06.17
NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB,00:00:03.43
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOURABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK,00:00:05.40
DO YOU WANT TO BANKRUPT THIS ADMINISTRATION,00:00:03.98
I AM JUST A MAN WHO WONDERS A DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:04.82
I DON'T MIND WARKING FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DO MISHAVING POOR WORKERS,00:00:06.67
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF VIED LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY,00:00:06.77
I'LL BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED LOSE,00:00:02.86
HE IS ON MY FAM,00:00:01.82
SELYDBERB'S NEED CHANGING AGAIN,00:00:03.46
THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DAITRIES AND INNUMERABLE COLORED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM,00:00:06.38
I LOCKED EYES WITH THE FISH IN THE TANK,00:00:02.93
GOODS ALWAYS HAVE A BET OF YIEW,00:00:02.78
SHE REVERSED THE CHARGES,00:00:03.58
I GOT TWO GIANT BUGBITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT,00:00:06.10
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,00:00:01.94
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP,00:00:03.98
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE,00:00:06.05
A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY,00:00:07.34
SHE PRIED FOR AN HOUR,00:00:02.38
THE IMMENSE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BEGAN TO TRAVEL BASTER,00:00:03.89
YOU CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEATS,00:00:02.54
THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT,00:00:05.16
THAT'S THE MAIN IDEA,00:00:01.73
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED,00:00:06.46
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARMED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION,00:00:04.78
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH,00:00:02.66
THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS,00:00:03.50
WHATYMEU ALWAYS WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH,00:00:03.05
DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED,00:00:04.99
SHE'S A FASTY LITTLE FERRET,00:00:02.95
PLEASE USE YOUR TURN SIGNAL,00:00:03.82
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO COME DOWN AND GET YOU,00:00:03.86
ARTIFICIAL NURAL NETWORKS CAN DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR,00:00:04.49
I FEEL GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME THAT WE HAVE SPENT TOGETHER,00:00:03.86
HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING WITH DEAD PANTS ON THE OISY STIFFINSIDE,00:00:06.43
HE IS WATCHING THE OTHER DOOR,00:00:01.99
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARNED SANTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP,00:00:06.50
PITA IS AN ITALIAN CLASSIC,00:00:02.90
ACTIVUSTS CLAIM THE PIPELINE THROUGH THE BALTIC SEAS LEAKING,00:00:04.49
A LITTLE LEMON GRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP,00:00:03.48
YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID,00:00:02.81
IT WAS ELYTMA'S TEST,00:00:02.57
SHE PROBABLY WARKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE,00:00:04.34
WHEN HE IS AN OLD MAN HE IS GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA,00:00:07.13
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNACCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM,00:00:05.66
THE RISK IF YOU GET IN HERE AND RIDE,00:00:03.22
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES,00:00:04.66
SHE IS ACCUSED OF STEALING WATCH,00:00:03.14
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.02
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE,00:00:05.64
A GHOSTLY FIGURE APPEARED,00:00:02.06
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ARGUING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST,00:00:05.95
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE,00:00:02.30
BUT SHE IS GONE,00:00:03.74
I'VE CROSSED THESE SANDS MANY TIMES SAID ONE OF THE CAMEL DRIVERS ONE NIGHT,00:00:05.06
WITHOUT RESPONDING THE GUARD ENTERED THE TENT WHERE HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME,00:00:07.51
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE,00:00:02.78
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:07.06
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT,00:00:05.54
THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WINE WAS REFRESHING,00:00:04.15
THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SAUT,00:00:03.91
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:05.28
A WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD CREATE A CONCISE TABLE,00:00:05.54
AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT BY HIMSELF,00:00:05.90
DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT,00:00:03.53
THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER,00:00:04.85
I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT,00:00:04.56
THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED,00:00:02.93
THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY,00:00:05.78
WE MUST BE GOOD,00:00:01.73
YOUARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS ALL THE ONSES,00:00:03.38
AND THE ODOUR OF THE ANIMALS BECAME A BOOK MORE TOLERABLE,00:00:04.20
HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING,00:00:06.19
THE HIGH HUMIDITY IS MAKING ME SWEAT,00:00:02.38
IT'S USUALLY CUSTOMARY TO BRING THE MONEY WITH YOU,00:00:08.50
I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO SOME PEOPLE,00:00:03.98
WE'D BETTER FORGET IT,00:00:01.70
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING,00:00:04.56
MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID,00:00:06.38
WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED,00:00:04.82
ADAM AS A CROOK,00:00:01.97
EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BE LIVED OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD,00:00:05.59
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK,00:00:04.42
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE,00:00:04.30
AND I THOUGHT HAY I THOUGHT I'D BE WOLVED TO BEAT,00:00:07.22
IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN,00:00:04.18
HOW D'YOU THINK THE TABLE LOOKS,00:00:01.94
PUTTING A POOL UNDER THIS FLOOR WAS A GREAT IDEA,00:00:03.77
HE GOT UP ADJUSTED HIS CLOTHING AND PICKED UP HIS POUCH,00:00:05.14
I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF,00:00:02.57
TWO YEARS AGO WRITIN ON THIS PLOT I HAD A RECURREN DREAM TO,00:00:05.06
BACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START TO ANY DAY,00:00:05.30
I NEVER KNEW GRANDMA TO BE SO DETERMINED BEFORE,00:00:04.06
THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL,00:00:02.86
IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY,00:00:04.90
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK OR WANT YOU,00:00:02.06
HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIKE THEM,00:00:03.86
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE,00:00:03.36
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPUTER,00:00:05.21
DUMBECAME HEAT OF THE DRAUGHTBOD,00:00:02.26
HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANDED IT TO THE MONK,00:00:05.11
MAC TUB THOUGHT THE BOY,00:00:03.62
EXACTLY ANSAID THE ALCHENIST,00:00:03.02
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:05.90
THE AIRPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY,00:00:03.14
IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT,00:00:05.42
NOBODY WANTED TO DISCUSS HOW WE ALL ENDED UP TRAPPED IN A GIANT LUNCH BOX,00:00:06.98
NATURE KNOWS ME AS THE WISEST BEING IN CREATION THE SUN SAIT,00:00:05.06
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID,00:00:03.86
I KNOW WHY I' WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE TAL,00:00:04.82
AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:05.66
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SAYING,00:00:05.62
SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL HIM PROFESSOR DAVIS,00:00:03.70
HE REACHED OVER AND PICKED UP A SHELF ON THE GROUND,00:00:04.06
I CANT QUITE NI YOU,00:00:02.74
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP,00:00:05.54
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US,00:00:04.70
BY NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE ID SPELP,00:00:03.10
SEND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE IN,00:00:01.94
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE,00:00:03.50
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY,00:00:09.50
MAYBE WEALL ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MULE,00:00:02.98
I WANT THOSE STAMPS,00:00:02.59
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD,00:00:03.05
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE,00:00:04.82
WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE,00:00:02.28
RATES AND CONFLICTS OF RESIANS ZERO POINTS,00:00:07.18
THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING,00:00:04.75
WITHOUT THE DATO SET THE ARTICLE IS USELESS,00:00:04.80
I HAVE SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:03.98
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.14
LAGUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM,00:00:06.60
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS,00:00:05.45
THE FARGE RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LESS TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:04.46
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID,00:00:04.15
MY TEXT DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS,00:00:03.65
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD,00:00:08.06
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORMAL RANDOMACT OF KINDNESS,00:00:09.34
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS THING,00:00:03.86
HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS,00:00:02.78
THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL,00:00:04.73
HOW ARE THE WEIGHTS COMPUTED,00:00:01.73
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS,00:00:03.26
BUT THE KING OF SOLOM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL,00:00:05.28
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD,00:00:05.95
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND HIM AT THE DATE PALMS,00:00:06.65
AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO,00:00:04.82
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY,00:00:06.10
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES,00:00:02.78
MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION,00:00:05.57
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,00:00:04.44
AND GOING OUT AND FIND THEM,00:00:02.06
I AM NON TRALCHMIS THE ALCHYMIST CONTINUED,00:00:04.30
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,00:00:04.90
I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE,00:00:02.59
DID YOU FIND IT,00:00:01.25
I WISH I COULD GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL,00:00:03.94
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHYMISTS THE WIND SAID,00:00:04.18
SHOOT THROUGH THE DESK,00:00:02.40
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUN,00:00:02.42
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ALBOWED ONE ANOTHER,00:00:05.66
WHY DON'T YOU FELLOWS GET YOUR OWN NEWS,00:00:03.10
THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAREHOUSE BALLS,00:00:04.13
I'LL TELL YOU WHY THEY DID IT,00:00:02.09
THE BONIFIER HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:04.32
THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT,00:00:09.22
PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER LIE THE WAYS NOGETED,00:00:02.90
IT SEEMS OLD AND WISE,00:00:05.62
HELD ME SIGND THEM,00:00:02.38
IT ALWAYS GETS ME RIGHT HERE,00:00:05.54
THEAVANIGIS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUS ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,00:00:04.08
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING,00:00:03.14
A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL WAS SHIVERED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF A CYLINDER,00:00:05.02
I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE,00:00:02.23
AN BUT A STILL TO BE ALONE WITH PONCIPLES,00:00:02.54
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY,00:00:04.42
AND A THING IS TERRIFIC,00:00:01.92
HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DURING HIS FIRST LESSON IN DRIVING SCHOOL,00:00:03.86
HE WAS EMINSTLY EXCITED AT THE MEANS,00:00:03.50
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:08.59
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS HE ASKED,00:00:03.41
CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE,00:00:03.98
DO I KNOCK OR SOMETHING,00:00:02.02
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR OLAMNAI OR POSPECTIVE STUDENTS,00:00:06.82
THE TIME OFT HE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK,00:00:04.06
MONDAY MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK,00:00:02.26
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY BABIES AS YOU LIKE,00:00:03.70
I'LL ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN,00:00:02.93
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY,00:00:03.55
THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING,00:00:03.46
THE BASKETBALL BOUNCED OF HIS SHIELD OF TITANIUM,00:00:03.29
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE,00:00:02.98
THOU WIND HAS MANY LAMES,00:00:03.86
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:04.39
HAVE TRUSTED MORE THAN YOUR LOVE FOR FAKIMON,00:00:11.38
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG UT A PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:04.58
SO THEN TRY HE SAY TO THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:03.91
WHY DO YOU THINK I BROUGHT YOU HERE,00:00:02.42
UNTIL MY WING WENT BAD,00:00:04.78
AT THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY,00:00:03.98
DID SHE SOLVE THE RIDDLE ALL BY HERSELF,00:00:03.70
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL,00:00:04.44
I HAVE LEARNED THINGS FROM THE SHEEP AND I HAVE LEARNED THINGS FROM CRYSTEL HE THOUGHT,00:00:06.53
JUST YOU AND I,00:00:02.50
EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC,00:00:06.10
HOW SHOULD I KNOW,00:00:02.14
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE,00:00:04.27
IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID,00:00:06.50
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HUMY MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING,00:00:06.19
CAN I HELP YOU ASKEDE MIND BEHINDE WENDEL,00:00:02.45
I'LL TALK TO YOU TO NIGHT,00:00:02.90
THE MONK WAS IRRITATED,00:00:02.21
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURIST PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC,00:00:06.74
THE ENGLISHMEN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THES STORY,00:00:07.18
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:08.18
DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE,00:00:05.93
JUDGED DEBORAH SET ME,00:00:02.21
A MISSING PARROT IS CALLED A POLYGAN,00:00:04.22
THE MORNING COST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS,00:00:06.19
THE WHOLE OFFICE WAS STRUCK BY A DEAFENING SILENCE,00:00:03.38
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT,00:00:04.68
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IPPROVE UPON IT,00:00:05.54
IN ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE I CAN HELP,00:00:04.58
SOMETIMES THE CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER,00:00:04.61
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY,00:00:06.31
DAN SHE FEELED HER BETTALL WAIT THE WATER AND LEFT,00:00:04.90
IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT,00:00:03.98
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOPS,00:00:06.86
WALKING ALONG IN SONGS HE HAD NO BOOTS,00:00:05.47
USING SCRIPT LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT,00:00:07.22
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID,00:00:03.50
THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS,00:00:05.28
AM THE ONE DAT NOSE,00:00:01.30
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET,00:00:02.78
THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID,00:00:04.94
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY A WAR,00:00:07.80
I DON'T THINK THAT OF FOIL O YOU,00:00:02.62
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.98
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH IS IMBEDDED IN THE GROUN,00:00:04.87
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD,00:00:04.15
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOYTHOUGHTS RUEFULLY,00:00:03.82
AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM,00:00:06.48
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED,00:00:07.06
THEY ARE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED,00:00:04.49
WE'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL,00:00:02.83
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS,00:00:06.02
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHERE IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE,00:00:04.85
SHE DECIDED AGAINST IT,00:00:02.90
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP,00:00:06.84
A GOD DOCTOR BULLSIPE,00:00:03.22
DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AND N ABANDONED CHURCH,00:00:05.69
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER TOWN,00:00:02.98
LIKE YOU TITYOU,00:00:02.30
THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY,00:00:05.18
HE TOLD FITIM A THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING,00:00:04.01
ALL THINGS ARE ONE,00:00:02.50
THINK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING,00:00:06.70
THE NERBA CITY OF SUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF,00:00:06.70
IN THOSE DAYS WATI PYLAT THE BABE HAD INIIDEOF ESTIMONY,00:00:03.89
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:04.42
I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS,00:00:03.10
MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS,00:00:04.63
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.48
YOU ARE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT AN GOLD,00:00:02.54
YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME,00:00:02.71
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON,00:00:02.50
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME THERE IF YOU CAN,00:00:03.02
AH YOU SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE,00:00:06.82
WHAT DID SHE SAY,00:00:02.04
THE REVIEW OF RELATED METHODS IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND INFORMATIVE,00:00:06.79
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE,00:00:04.63
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING,00:00:04.82
MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOME ONE THE BOY SUGGESTED,00:00:08.42
MECCA IS A LOT FURTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:03.84
THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE,00:00:06.98
THEY BECOME THE SOUL OF THE WORLD,00:00:03.07
THEY REMINDED HIM OF THE OLD MAN,00:00:05.50
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:05.71
THE PIXAL PROBABILITIES ARE CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL STATE,00:00:04.32
THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FARTHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON,00:00:03.94
IT DOESN'T MATTER HE SAID TO HIS SHEEP,00:00:03.14
HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS HE SPOKE OF THE PROPHET,00:00:04.80
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLAMOTS ATMOSPHERE IN OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FATURES,00:00:05.42
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOURABILITY BEGINNERS LACK,00:00:04.08
THE TREES SWAYED UNIFORMLY IN THE BREEZE,00:00:03.12
HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER,00:00:04.22
ENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON,00:00:06.02
I AM AN UNSUPERSTITIOUS ARAB IN A BELIEF IN OUR PROVERBS,00:00:07.75
IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THIS,00:00:02.54
THE BOY SAID NOTHING,00:00:03.98
RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS,00:00:02.86
AND RUN RUDOLF RUN TO MY ROCKING PLANE,00:00:04.70
WHEN THE PAN HAD COOLED THE MONK AND THE BOY LOOKED AT IT DAZZLED,00:00:03.77
YOU'D BETTER GET YOUR FRIENDS,00:00:02.23
NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE BACK IN THAT SAME VILLAGE,00:00:04.66
I BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAID,00:00:02.52
THE OLD MAN LEAVED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO,00:00:05.35
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP,00:00:06.00
YOU GAVE THEM EVERYTHING I HAD THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.67
THEY WERE DECIDED THAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS INCIDENT,00:00:03.53
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID,00:00:06.14
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH,00:00:03.05
IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE,00:00:03.22
THAT BAKER HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLAINING THE THOUGHT,00:00:07.13
WHO'S ENGINEER THIS GETS AWAY,00:00:08.06
WHEN I FIRST REACHED THREE TO IT I THOUGHT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD WAS PERFECT,00:00:04.99
I'M PROUD OF YOU,00:00:01.18
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE,00:00:04.22
YOU'LL WEAKEN WHEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE JESEBEL,00:00:02.86
THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP,00:00:03.38
AND THAT'S WHERE THE POWER OF LOVE COMES IN,00:00:02.71
HOWEVER THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN POORLY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLY,00:00:06.14
THEY JUST WON'T LET ANYBODY TALK POLITICS TO THEM,00:00:04.34
BUT I'LL MAKE YOU AMERIA A BUSINESS PROPOSITION,00:00:03.70
NOT THAT I WAS LISTENING BUT I NOTICED THAT YOU SOUNDED REALLY STRESSED WHEN YOU WERE EXPLAINING THE SITUATION TO HIM,00:00:08.66
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DONE HIS HEART LEAPT,00:00:05.02
AM SENDING ANUMBER AT BATH,00:00:01.70
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:05.14
HELP ME THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.46
I'LL TIKE CARE OF IT,00:00:01.56
HELP ME THE BOY SAID,00:00:05.21
THERE WERE JUST DROWING CODIED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBTURE TEXTS,00:00:04.94
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS,00:00:04.87
HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T ESEN EVEN WITHA,00:00:04.82
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO,00:00:04.70
I FOUND A LITTLE CRAB OF ABOUT TWENTY PAPLES SURRANDING THE HEUCAL,00:00:06.26
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND,00:00:02.66
THERE IS NO LETTER,00:00:01.78
HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE,00:00:03.89
AFRAID IT MIGHT RAIN,00:00:03.29
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND,00:00:04.66
I TURNED AND AS I DID SO THE SCREW MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT,00:00:05.11
THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID,00:00:04.01
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL IMBEDDED,00:00:02.45
NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MEN WARE SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY,00:00:10.13
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBE OF WARS,00:00:05.62
THIS NUTRITION CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF SERE,00:00:04.46
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:04.22
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT,00:00:03.46
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLAP,00:00:02.81
WHERE DID HE KEEV HIS MONEY,00:00:02.86
YOU HAVE TOO CROSSED ME ENTIRE SAHARO DESERT SAID THE YOUNG MAN,00:00:08.81
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGER BRED MAN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FOYAGE,00:00:06.91
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS,00:00:01.90
THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGAGE,00:00:02.06
HIGE AS TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:06.94
IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME,00:00:05.14
IT WAS AN ELEMENT OF HER SEXUALITY,00:00:03.02
IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW,00:00:03.22
I WILL CALL THE POLICE,00:00:02.57
YOU'RE UNLUCKY TOO THE FAD HAROB SAID,00:00:03.58
THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAD OF WAR,00:00:07.18
HE PUT A SIGN OF THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEAR BY,00:00:04.82
NO I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD,00:00:05.42
THEN WHAT DOES SHE WANT WITH YOU,00:00:03.19
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES,00:00:03.65
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON,00:00:04.30
PLEASE DON'T CRY,00:00:01.82
SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT,00:00:03.00
RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS,00:00:02.69
THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.08
THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT,00:00:03.38
WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT,00:00:05.69
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS,00:00:04.56
MAGGIE AND UNCLE KENNY SOLD WAR BONDS,00:00:03.02
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR ME A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING,00:00:09.48
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OF THE CIRCULAR EDGE,00:00:04.63
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOSHER HE SAID,00:00:05.50
HE'LL BE READ AT ONE TIME,00:00:02.21
FOOTPRINTS OF MUD AND CLAY WERE ON THE FLOOR,00:00:04.68
THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS ZEBOS HORS REN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR,00:00:08.06
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE ME ALONE,00:00:04.20
EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:03.10
YOU WANTO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE,00:00:03.38
ALL YO'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM,00:00:02.30
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL,00:00:05.16
THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:02.86
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT OF THE MONK,00:00:05.40
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY ETHICAL READING OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF,00:00:04.97
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:04.44
I WOULD BURY IT IN THE GARDEN,00:00:03.82
CAN I SEE BLOOD ORGY OF THE LEATHER GIRLS AT A MOVIE HOUSE,00:00:04.66
THE BOY CONTINUED TO LEAST INTO HIS HEART AS HE CROSSED THE DESERT,00:00:04.01
I COULD JUST PUBLISH MY COAT BUT THAT WOULDN'T REVEAL ALL THE LITTLE LESSONS I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY,00:00:06.26
I HOPE SOME OF THE LINES MAKE YOU SMILE,00:00:03.22
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY,00:00:05.90
SHOW ME SOME GRATITUDE,00:00:02.98
PREFETCHING IS USED TO AVOID KASH MISZES,00:00:03.46
THE BOYS SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER,00:00:04.01
BUT W YOU MAIN TELLIN ME WHO GOES OUT,00:00:03.02
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:03.26
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING,00:00:02.54
LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT,00:00:04.10
FROM WHERE HE SAT HE COULD OBSERVE THE PLAZA,00:00:05.98
HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET,00:00:05.78
A MONG TRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATE,00:00:02.86
AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME,00:00:04.18
THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION,00:00:04.10
YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS,00:00:03.41
THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID,00:00:03.70
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY T,00:00:05.50
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:05.04
NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD,00:00:05.26
MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU,00:00:02.40
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:04.82
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THE LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID HIS SON,00:00:05.98
IS A SIMPLE STORY,00:00:02.14
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES,00:00:04.90
THE THOM PEFONDE DOG TO WICK,00:00:03.50
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET,00:00:03.72
THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GAN TO FIND THE ARCHEMIST,00:00:05.64
I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:05.06
AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHIMIST SAID,00:00:04.75
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO GOVERED WITH SUN WINDING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:06.72
NOBODY KNEW WHO MALCOMB WAS,00:00:03.98
THE ITALIAN GOT HER WORDS MIXED UP,00:00:04.22
AND FIND OUT WHERE THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE IS,00:00:03.22
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN,00:00:02.06
OF COURSE THIS ONLY REDUCES THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM,00:00:04.58
THEN WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HASN'T AT LEAST CALLED UP,00:00:04.18
I'M ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE,00:00:03.22
THE PROCESS OF INCRIPTING THE HASH VALUE OF A MASSARCH IS CALLED DETUTIL SIGNATURE,00:00:07.78
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:05.54
THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT,00:00:02.78
A TANEL LIKE A DUCI BRIO,00:00:02.06
IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:06.10
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:02.28
I WON'T SHUT UP,00:00:01.75
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION,00:00:05.28
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD,00:00:06.29
I LOCKED ICE WITH A FISH ING A TANK,00:00:03.91
MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT,00:00:03.12
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHEMIST THE WIND SAID,00:00:06.50
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE,00:00:03.00
HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SICAMBOR,00:00:07.03
YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU TOO THE FAT ARAB SAID,00:00:03.91
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS,00:00:03.50
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT,00:00:04.10
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE,00:00:05.86
THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTIO,00:00:04.22
THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERYONE STOOD,00:00:03.22
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID,00:00:03.65
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME,00:00:02.50
CAMELS ARE TREACHEROUS THEY WALK THOUSANDS OF PACES AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE,00:00:06.38
IF I DON'T VANGE IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME,00:00:03.50
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE,00:00:03.82
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:03.98
GOOD BAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.50
THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO BE ON THAT ROOF,00:00:03.50
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:07.20
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES,00:00:03.07
IS THERE A MISSUS JOSHUA,00:00:02.78
THE HORIZON WAS TINKED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED,00:00:07.15
AND IT GOES FOR YOU TOO,00:00:02.57
SUDDENLY THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TIME IN A DAY BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS COMMUTING,00:00:07.22
I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU,00:00:04.51
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES,00:00:04.46
NEVER GIVE UP,00:00:03.10
IAVE GOT THROUGH THE BATETHE,00:00:03.02
THE NEXT THING THE DOB WONES AS A WOMB,00:00:03.70
I'M AN OLD SUPERSTITIOUS ARAB AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROVERBS,00:00:03.82
WHAT DID HE BUY A PAPER FOR,00:00:03.98
WILL YOU TRUST HIM THAT HE DOES IT RIGHT,00:00:03.10
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME UNDER ONE CONDITION,00:00:02.76
IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH,00:00:01.78
YOUR DEA FRALID IN HIM,00:00:02.74
SOMEBODY'S THRYING THIS KIT,00:00:02.14
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD,00:00:06.10
AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST,00:00:06.34
THE FIRE BURNED THE FOX,00:00:02.35
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING,00:00:04.13
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID,00:00:03.86
AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE,00:00:04.27
I AIN'T SEEN EM FOR A WEEK,00:00:02.38
WHEN DOING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WE HAVE TO FIND A SUITABLE TRADE OFF BETWEEN EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION,00:00:08.14
THEY FORGOT THAT LEED COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFIL,00:00:08.06
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SAD TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:06.38
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF WIDE,00:00:03.94
STADDY IN TROUBLE,00:00:02.02
RHAD IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON,00:00:03.34
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN,00:00:06.22
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN,00:00:01.85
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN,00:00:05.42
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERD WILL SEND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET AN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:07.06
I FEEL LIKE A BOOT LAKER,00:00:03.17
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED,00:00:03.60
THAT'S WHY I'M QUETTING,00:00:03.34
WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE AUTHOR,00:00:02.54
OF COURSE WITH FEW MORE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING,00:00:03.89
THEY HAVE POWERFUL FORCES ON BOTH SIDES AND THE WAR IS IMPORTANT TO BOTH ARMIES,00:00:06.62
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHERE I WAS TATTOOED,00:00:03.50
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW,00:00:04.22
IF A CIN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU WILL BE A HAPPY MAN,00:00:06.94
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZED I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE,00:00:05.76
THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH,00:00:04.70
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:08.52
THE ARTICLE SHOULD CONTAIN YOU ARE L WHERE THE DATA SET CAN BE DOWN LOADED,00:00:04.82
BUT HE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK,00:00:06.00
I'VE HANDLED A GOOD MANY BIG PROMOTIONS IN MY TIME,00:00:04.18
IT'S ONLY A FEW BOTS MUMBLED OVER YOU BY A JUDGE,00:00:05.50
WE HAD TO RUSH DOWN THE MINUTE IT HAPPENED,00:00:04.39
HOW MUCH IS YOUR EQUITY IN,00:00:01.90
WE CANNOT FORGET THAT FARCE,00:00:02.52
IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN A PEARAMENS,00:00:03.05
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO,00:00:04.94
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.94
AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER,00:00:03.50
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE,00:00:04.73
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH,00:00:03.74
I WILL DO YOU LIKE IT,00:00:04.34
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY,00:00:05.74
IF I TOLD YOU IT MIGHT NOT COME TRUE,00:00:04.01
BUT MAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT,00:00:05.47
HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DOONES SURROUNDING THUT ENCAMPMENT,00:00:06.58
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO DO,00:00:05.90
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:03.77
THEN ONE DAY AS TA BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:03.58
DIDN'T YOU TELL HER,00:00:01.94
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTISED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED,00:00:06.34
THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS,00:00:04.73
THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED,00:00:04.73
SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND,00:00:06.72
I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS,00:00:03.60
THEI TINIEST IT EN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK,00:00:03.58
IT'S USUALLY CUSTOMARY TO BRING THE MONEY WITH YOU,00:00:07.90
UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN,00:00:04.80
BUT HE APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE OF ANY DANGER,00:00:04.10
THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO BE ON THAT ROOF,00:00:04.22
THE FAMILIES WILL BE HERE SOON,00:00:03.26
EVERY ONE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG KNOWS WHAT THAT DESTINY IS,00:00:06.82
I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ON YOU,00:00:03.22
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DIS,00:00:06.38
THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT,00:00:03.17
WHAT IS IT ABOUT,00:00:05.09
THE BOY BECAME FEARFUL THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG,00:00:05.98
WE KNOW THAT AND WE'RE USED TO IT,00:00:03.41
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:02.54
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR,00:00:06.10
THE NEWS WAS CHILLIN TO SAY THE LEAST,00:00:03.55
AT THAT POINT THE OMENS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR TREASURE IS BURIED FOREVER,00:00:04.68
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS,00:00:05.45
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGH,00:00:02.50
THE DESERT WAS ONE TO SEA HE SAID,00:00:02.98
HE WANTED THEM TO BE A PARK OF ROR INHERITANCE,00:00:04.46
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES,00:00:03.29
HE APPEARED WITH THE FUSTARS OF EVENING,00:00:03.14
I DIDN'T KNOW SHEPHERDS KNEW HOW TO READ SAID A GIRL'S VOICE BEHIND HIM,00:00:08.14
AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIES,00:00:05.54
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE,00:00:06.17
IAM NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHIMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSE MEN,00:00:07.22
I WANTED TO SLEEP A LITTLE LONGER HE THOUGHT,00:00:04.27
IT'S A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS NATURE AND THE WORLD,00:00:04.06
TURNING THE AIR CONDITIONING ON LEADS TO AN INCREASED FUEL CONSUMPTION,00:00:06.24
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:03.12
NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW,00:00:06.50
THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.42
I WISH AT I HAD A LIKE TO SMOKE BY,00:00:04.54
IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERY ONE'S FREEDOM,00:00:06.46
I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES,00:00:08.74
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER,00:00:07.46
I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST,00:00:02.78
TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF,00:00:05.66
BUT THEY'RE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN,00:00:01.94
AND THERE YE WERE INBAD,00:00:02.45
THE HYDROGEN GAS ESCAPED,00:00:02.95
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP A LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNRIGHT,00:00:10.08
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNCELLOR,00:00:05.04
TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THE SKY FIRST,00:00:03.14
THE OLD MAN LEAPED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO,00:00:05.30
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN NAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING,00:00:05.66
HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER HIMSELF,00:00:09.70
I WONDER WHATS KEEPING MOTHER,00:00:03.26
ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED,00:00:03.62
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN,00:00:03.14
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN,00:00:04.49
THAT'S WHY I FEEL I DESERVE PART OF WHAT YOU FIND,00:00:03.24
AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY,00:00:04.82
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION,00:00:09.26
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,00:00:02.26
GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE,00:00:05.14
IT'S STILRASIS SAID A CAMEL DRIVER,00:00:03.02
WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO,00:00:05.40
THE NEED OF KILLING SIDE THE LAKE,00:00:04.61
AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM ANTO THE WOMAN HE LOVED,00:00:06.74
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.86
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK,00:00:02.98
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DARCHESS AND TRAKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS,00:00:05.06
WHY YOUVITE ME,00:00:02.23
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE ABOUT TICKETS TO A FRICA,00:00:05.14
THE CARABAN MOONED TOWARDS THE EAST,00:00:04.34
HET WAS SEEN ODDLY IN THE MORNING ROSSING ROVER IS DRAN,00:00:08.06
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:03.84
BUT I AM GOING TO EACH IT THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.82
YOU RESENTED ME FROM THE FIRST MOMENT YOU SAW ME,00:00:02.98
THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT,00:00:02.59
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE,00:00:01.75
AND SUCCO FOR IT,00:00:02.42
THIS WAS MY DESTINY NOT YOURS THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.08
DARON NEVER SAW A BOTTLE TILL HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD,00:00:05.54
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I'D BUILT TA SUPER COMPUTER,00:00:04.15
I MISSED YOU AND I COULDN'T CALL YOU BUT I TRIED,00:00:03.70
KET THE RIOT GEAR,00:00:03.12
HE CALLED TO THE BAYA AND IT TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNE ARONDING THE ENCAPMENT,00:00:05.76
LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOUR LEAF CLOVERS,00:00:07.94
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAS BEEN UNCOVERED,00:00:05.95
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION,00:00:05.18
DEY SAY IT'S FAKE,00:00:02.90
THE BOY THOUGHT OF PHATIMA,00:00:02.50
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY,00:00:01.70
JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM,00:00:02.95
BUKE I'M YOUR SISTAR,00:00:06.02
FOLK IS NOT MY FAVORITE MUSIC JONRA,00:00:03.46
NOBODY KNEW WHOM MALCOLME WAS,00:00:03.60
MUS METURUITS ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:05.78
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED,00:00:03.67
WE MISS YOU N MISSHAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I'M SO HAPPY THE JUTES YOU GOT TO CATCH UP,00:00:05.66
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY WHO PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD,00:00:05.23
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID,00:00:05.71
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BOOK WHICH WAS EMBELLED IN THE GROUND,00:00:06.98
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TEACH ME SOME OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW,00:00:03.50
EVERYONE LAUGHED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM,00:00:03.19
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME,00:00:05.38
WEARING HIS NEW SANDALS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS SILENTLY,00:00:04.85
THESE ARE NOT CAMELS,00:00:02.83
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO,00:00:06.94
HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SYCAMOR,00:00:04.08
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T USE TO FALLON ANY MO,00:00:02.74
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPUTER,00:00:05.78
YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL,00:00:07.30
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE,00:00:04.34
UPON RECHARNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN,00:00:05.23
YOU CAN DO A LOT JUST USING YOUR VOICE BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW TIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF REACHING FOR A MOUSE,00:00:09.31
HE POINT TO A TRAILO OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE,00:00:03.14
MECA IS A LOT FURTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:05.57
AS THEY WATCHED THE PLAN IT SEEMED TO GROW LARGER ONCE MORE,00:00:09.74
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE IT,00:00:03.34
BUT NOW I AM SAD AND ALONE,00:00:02.50
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING,00:00:03.55
DON'T YOU KNOW ME,00:00:02.14
YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN,00:00:02.86
I HAVE HAD THIS SHOP FOR THIRTY YEARS,00:00:04.78
CHARGE M I NO THINKS O,00:00:02.14
MY DOG GAVE A LIFE TO SAVE MY CHILD,00:00:02.95
DON'T TRY TO ENTER INTO THE LIFE OF THE OASIS,00:00:03.74
THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW,00:00:04.39
I DON'T BLAME YOU,00:00:02.78
CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT,00:00:03.58
THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IS NOURISHED BY PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS,00:00:03.67
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:06.77
THE EDWARD VELI I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PETEM  AL WAING ONE OF THEM THET,00:00:09.17
THE SNAKES LITHERED TOWARD THE SHADED BOULDERS UNDER THE CLIFF,00:00:04.01
FROM HERE ON YOU BE ALONE THE ALCHEMISTS SAID,00:00:03.94
THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM,00:00:04.58
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TUCKINGTON'S SUT,00:00:03.48
AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TWO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCAMIST,00:00:10.01
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAIN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP,00:00:05.18
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL,00:00:02.50
HE WADN'T FARING MUCH BETHER,00:00:02.59
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE,00:00:02.40
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE NINE JOPS WAITING FOR THIS GUY,00:00:03.62
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN,00:00:03.00
MOM TOO GRANDMA TO THE GARDEN CENTRE TO HEAR THE LATTER NAMES OF PLANTS,00:00:07.58
SANDA READ ALOUD THE STRANGE EXERT,00:00:03.62
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COM,00:00:05.26
THE CRIMINALS FONTED THE POLICE OF E SUSIN PRISONDA,00:00:03.70
AND IN THAT WAY DEMONTS PASSED,00:00:03.46
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE,00:00:04.20
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THAT'S A CRAY,00:00:03.10
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HE SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES,00:00:05.35
THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES,00:00:08.40
BY IS CERTAINTE SARTON ANS,00:00:02.86
STARTING WITH HIS OWN,00:00:02.95
THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING,00:00:02.71
WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE,00:00:04.90
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY,00:00:03.02
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP,00:00:06.36
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE,00:00:05.71
UTMOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED,00:00:05.06
HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION,00:00:06.26
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH,00:00:04.58
THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL,00:00:04.10
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY INTO THE DARK,00:00:05.38
BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN,00:00:04.30
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW,00:00:04.94
JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR,00:00:07.94
THEY HAVE A CHEAP SAUSAGE AND FRIES OF THE BRURIE TO MORROW,00:00:03.26
THEY ARE NOT MY SHEEP ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NASTALJAH,00:00:06.89
MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD,00:00:03.98
THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY,00:00:07.78
FLAZER TAG IS A GAME QUITE SIMILAR TO PAINTBALL,00:00:06.10
WHOOULD YOU SAY IT WAS,00:00:03.38
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID,00:00:03.62
AH DOUN'T BELIEVE IT,00:00:02.52
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW,00:00:02.54
THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,00:00:02.66
EVIDENTLY WHERE THE FLOOR SHOW,00:00:02.62
IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT,00:00:03.46
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME,00:00:07.25
THE BOY DO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WO SAID,00:00:04.22
CAN YOU GET IN THIS DESK,00:00:02.52
ELI WON FIRST BRICE IN THE SPENNING COMPETITION,00:00:03.53
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE CONFORDED THING DO YOU,00:00:03.46
BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID,00:00:03.89
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:04.73
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES,00:00:03.19
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS,00:00:06.10
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM,00:00:06.26
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING,00:00:02.16
I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL,00:00:08.14
BUT THEY DON'T COUNT,00:00:02.88
ONLY CRIS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS,00:00:03.36
NOW I WANT YOU TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT,00:00:02.54
I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY,00:00:03.65
HOLD ON A MINNUT,00:00:03.38
SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS,00:00:07.63
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY,00:00:05.50
HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:04.30
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS,00:00:04.70
YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DEGINITY,00:00:09.22
BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER,00:00:03.72
AN L E D WAS INDICATING THE PROXIMITY DETECTOR WAS WORKING PROPERLY,00:00:07.10
THAT'S WHAT KILLED HIM,00:00:02.14
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:08.42
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR MAY A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING,00:00:07.66
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME,00:00:02.78
I'M GOING TO THEM,00:00:02.71
THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRAGGED THE WINE ITA LAUGH,00:00:04.82
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT,00:00:04.82
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:03.96
WHAT'S THE WORLD'S GRATEST LIE THE BOY ASKED COMPLETELY SURPRISED,00:00:04.94
THEY DADN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PLACE IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED,00:00:04.78
BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID,00:00:04.70
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES,00:00:03.58
THEADOSON WAS A BOAT AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VAZES,00:00:06.91
I'M GOING TO THEM,00:00:01.49
YOU'RE THE WOK OF THE WORLD,00:00:02.50
YOU SHOULD HAVE VALUATED IN A PERCEPTIAL EXPERIMENT,00:00:04.66
THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO,00:00:02.33
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT,00:00:04.10
THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY,00:00:02.90
BUT THAALTOMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON,00:00:02.74
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,00:00:02.14
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKIN,00:00:04.54
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERY ONE WHO PASSED,00:00:05.11
THAT'S ALL MARK EVER TALKS ABOUT,00:00:03.58
IT BROUGHT HIS HARD INTO HIS MOUTH,00:00:02.95
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:02.76
HE LIVES AT THE AL FOUM OESIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID,00:00:05.90
HEATEN ENSHORRIN'S BUSINESS,00:00:02.57
THEY DOR VARIED WARNINGS ABOUT PHIVIS AND BARBARIAN TRIBES,00:00:04.82
THEY WERE KNOWN AS TIUS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMAN AND THE EL DELLI,00:00:09.05
MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE,00:00:03.50
LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS,00:00:04.46
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:08.59
FROM ZENON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISION,00:00:03.74
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME,00:00:05.30
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:04.01
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY,00:00:02.28
HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HATE S THE BOY,00:00:05.06
MULLB AT THESE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TAIM ANDE,00:00:06.24
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE,00:00:05.83
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START,00:00:03.86
THAT IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON,00:00:02.02
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES,00:00:03.98
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH,00:00:04.39
IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED,00:00:19.51
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID,00:00:03.86
I DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'D NEVER HAD HAMBURGER ALPOR,00:00:05.06
BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY,00:00:03.53
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT,00:00:03.41
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT,00:00:06.82
DID YOU WANT TO SEE HER ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT,00:00:03.55
SAYS FERACHE TO GO THE LINET,00:00:03.26
HE HAD FOUND WHAT HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN,00:00:04.80
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DEAR,00:00:02.06
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL,00:00:02.57
BUT HORSES TIRED BIT BY BIT,00:00:02.54
THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK,00:00:03.89
THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE WAS SWINGING IN THE GALE,00:00:05.50
THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY AT THE BURGLER SHOP IN DOWNTOWN,00:00:05.35
SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ENTIRELY TRUE,00:00:06.38
HE'S AFTER THE MONEY,00:00:13.73
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.02
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MEN WANTED TO TRAVEL TO,00:00:04.82
SO HOW WELL WE NAME OL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.70
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS RETAINING ON HIS BODY,00:00:03.12
LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL,00:00:03.98
SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT RODE ALL SAID THE SON,00:00:03.86
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:11.06
I WAS SITTING WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHEN HE ASKED ME HAY HANNAH CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOUR,00:00:05.04
HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT,00:00:04.10
YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE READING IT,00:00:03.48
WELL MON'S GONE KET SITTING AGAIN FOR THE WEEK AND IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER,00:00:04.10
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NOT THE JETTING OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET,00:00:03.34
ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARD HIS DESTINY,00:00:04.94
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY,00:00:04.58
THE MAN WIT WITH HAPPINESS,00:00:03.94
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.87
HE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE MERCHANT TO AWAKEN AND OPEN THE SHOP,00:00:04.20
THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE,00:00:07.68
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.26
YOU'VE GOT LEAPSIC ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH,00:00:02.71
MACHINE GUN FIRE AWOKE THE FUGITIVES AND SENT THEM INTO A FRENZY,00:00:05.76
ATHONDES ONE DAY IN OF FIELDS,00:00:02.86
I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY,00:00:03.62
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:06.38
SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHTS THADED TROUBLE WITH A HAZING SOUND,00:00:04.61
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THEIR EYES CONVEYED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR SOULS,00:00:06.98
I NEED YOU TO PEA SPONTENEOUS HE HAS CATTED ME OUT YOUR DINGDING,00:00:06.24
WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY,00:00:03.82
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED,00:00:04.01
VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT,00:00:02.64
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ROUND SIX O'CLOCK,00:00:04.18
IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH,00:00:04.78
USED TO HUNT RABBITS THERE MYSELF,00:00:05.02
THE GENIUS WERE THE SPIRIT OF GOOD IN EVIL,00:00:03.50
NO THE OCHEMIS AUNTERED,00:00:02.45
HE PUT HIS HAT CLOTHED IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMELS SKIN,00:00:05.30
IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD,00:00:03.82
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,00:00:02.14
THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING,00:00:09.00
WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH FROM US,00:00:03.55
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASH FLOAT,00:00:04.15
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPED,00:00:04.44
HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS,00:00:03.98
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.26
THE LITTLE GIRL WANTED TO HAVE A BALLOON BUT WAS TOO SHY TO ASK,00:00:04.99
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,00:00:02.02
HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.30
YOUR HAIR RATHER URNY,00:00:02.62
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US,00:00:05.18
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:08.06
OXYGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR US BUT SOME BACTERIOR DON'T NEED IT AT ALL,00:00:05.62
BEING MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD ISN'T NONSENSE,00:00:03.84
I'M JUST YOUR LITTLE RENT COLLECTOR,00:00:03.98
HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY,00:00:03.98
WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY,00:00:04.34
THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WILL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL,00:00:05.66
THE BOY APPROISED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHYMIS,00:00:03.91
SO USUALLY A KEY PRESS INSTEAD OF A CLICK IS USED,00:00:05.18
IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS,00:00:02.54
IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN,00:00:03.98
IT SCALLED A PRINCIPAL FAVOURABILITY,00:00:03.02
YOU GOT THE MAYOR AND PULLMAN BACKED AGAINST THE WALL,00:00:03.46
BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND,00:00:04.56
WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY,00:00:02.30
AN WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALE EM HE INSISTED,00:00:03.94
BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD SLAPPED,00:00:03.36
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:04.92
I'M SENDING IT OVER WITH BETH,00:00:02.90
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE,00:00:04.25
THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS IS SAID THE OLD MAN,00:00:03.86
THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW,00:00:02.90
I THINK IT'S ALL BAD BID HUNTING NOW I SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED E,00:00:07.82
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM,00:00:01.99
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT,00:00:03.26
IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WORK,00:00:05.76
WE'RE REFAGIES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID,00:00:05.42
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE,00:00:05.78
THE LOAFERS AND GULF KERRIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION,00:00:05.95
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COLD MILKY SOCKEE SERVED IN A BOX,00:00:05.66
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING HE SAID AS HE LED THE BOY OUTSIDE,00:00:06.84
WHY ARE YOU CARRYING MONEY ASKED THE TRIBESMAN WHEN HE HAD SEARCHED A BOY'S BED,00:00:06.26
YOU ALL KNOW ME,00:00:03.48
USING SCRIP LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT TRIES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT,00:00:05.98
IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE STAMP IN THE WORLD,00:00:03.26
ALWAYS HEAT THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID,00:00:05.30
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:03.70
AND FOR WISE MEN GAUD DOES THE MATTLE THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST,00:00:05.16
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT,00:00:09.58
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:09.79
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY,00:00:04.82
AFTER ALL WHO DOESN'T WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND THE CHIEF GREAT HEIGHTS,00:00:05.64
GIVE MY ONLY VOR PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE A PRIVATE ONE,00:00:05.50
THE SHOP FOLK WERE STUCKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BELL ROOM WINDOW,00:00:07.06
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:04.54
THE TROUBLE WITH USING THIS FOR ALL ONSCREEN MOMENT IS THAT RECOGNITION ACCURACY ISN'T ALWAYS PERFECT,00:00:06.65
PODATOES ARE LESS PAYS SAVING TEHORABLE AND CHIP THAN PASTA,00:00:07.22
SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER,00:00:04.08
I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARYBOOSY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN,00:00:05.06
MOST MATERIALITS ARE MORE OR LESS ROUND,00:00:02.52
YOU GOT YOUR WATER MELON,00:00:05.11
THE BOY SMILED TO HIMSELF,00:00:02.78
AND THE FALCAN THAN NURASIOUS MAN,00:00:03.17
THE APPLES ARE IN THE BASKET NEAR THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT,00:00:04.51
SHE'S KIND AND SWEET AND CONSIDERATE,00:00:03.94
YOU WANT THE MUN,00:00:02.98
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD,00:00:03.10
YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED,00:00:05.33
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO,00:00:03.43
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TADDERS,00:00:04.06
PALM TREES GROWS TWICE AS BIG VEAR,00:00:03.38
YOU WILL TAKE FIFTY AND LIKE IT,00:00:02.66
SO WE THEIR HEARTS SPEAK MORE AND MORE SOFTLY,00:00:03.89
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFASED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE,00:00:05.66
HE MADE US STAND AND WATCH EM PAINT FOR LIKE AN HOUR,00:00:03.96
NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO,00:00:03.79
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:04.03
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK,00:00:03.98
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE,00:00:02.38
THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH,00:00:04.82
DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE,00:00:06.62
I REMEMBER ALL I SAT ON THE TABLE DURING THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:07.42
HE BELIEVED IN OMENS,00:00:02.62
THE CHEMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING,00:00:04.22
MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY,00:00:03.14
THE BOY WAS SUDDENLY HAPPY TO BE THERE AT THE WAREHOUSE,00:00:03.94
HESET AND NEWSPAPER OVREMAN,00:00:02.86
YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT,00:00:02.50
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SALATER'S ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY,00:00:06.41
THEY REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HOWLED,00:00:04.82
AND BECAUSE THAT CHIBSTEKERED WAR I WANED TO GO AWAY  SEEKING THOU KANST,00:00:06.55
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,00:00:03.26
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGIN ITS LUCK,00:00:02.93
WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY,00:00:02.42
THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING,00:00:06.14
LEMENTON THIME SHOULD GO WELL,00:00:03.22
THEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES,00:00:02.50
I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARRY BEUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN,00:00:06.38
EVERYONE IS JUST STANDING BY THE BUILDING WAITING TO GET IN,00:00:03.67
THE OMENS HAVE BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL,00:00:02.45
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY,00:00:03.70
STRANGE IMAGES PASS THROUGH MY MIND,00:00:03.46
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:02.78
YOU ARE GOING TO RUN INTO THE GOVERNOR,00:00:03.77
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME,00:00:05.76
MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB,00:00:03.34
HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN,00:00:01.92
IT'S A COLD SAID THE BOY A BIT IS POINTED,00:00:03.50
TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF,00:00:06.67
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A RALPH'S CHILD BEFORE,00:00:03.22
WHAT OLLAR HELD TO NIGHT,00:00:02.06
THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS,00:00:03.53
HI'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO,00:00:02.74
YOUR DENIS CALLED YESTERDAY,00:00:02.66
DACK WAS HIS WORK,00:00:04.42
THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAREHOUSE BOSS,00:00:04.10
PANDRA READ ALOUD THIS STRANGE EXCERT,00:00:03.58
STANLEY FELT EXHILARATED,00:00:03.94
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANY ONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURG OR HELPER,00:00:05.21
I WON'T EVER TELL A SOUL,00:00:02.38
TELL THEM IT'S A SERIOUS CASE OF DELIRIUM,00:00:02.78
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER,00:00:05.64
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF,00:00:04.30
I JEST WANT TO DREAM ABIT MICCA,00:00:03.53
NEVER GIVE UP,00:00:02.18
THE PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:05.50
YET EACH FELL TO HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER,00:00:04.70
THE TWO MEN EXCHANGED SOME WORDS IN ARABIC AND THE BAR OWNER SEEMED IRRITATED,00:00:05.69
HE WHAT DOOS EH,00:00:02.21
STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD,00:00:02.71
RBUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:07.10
THEY DON'T SEE THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE,00:00:06.24
DESPAIR IS SOMETHING THAT HAUNTS US AT NIGHT,00:00:03.62
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING,00:00:01.34
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT A BRET DATE AND WENT FORWARD,00:00:07.56
TEAM FLOUR WILL MEET U AT POINT B WITH TEAM FAV,00:00:03.50
YOU'LL BE THE COUNSILLOR OF THE OASIS,00:00:03.82
TURN UP THE VILLLOOM,00:00:03.24
HITTING THE DERIT AND ESCAPEKEYS I THINK,00:00:05.74
SHE COMES BY IT NATURALLY,00:00:05.06
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PAN HANDLING AROUND HERE,00:00:03.62
HOW IS BAZILA GOING TO HANDLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE CUE AND CUE,00:00:04.80
THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THE REALIZATION OF HIS DREAM THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS BECAME,00:00:04.75
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID,00:00:06.70
THEY FORMED HEAT THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY,00:00:03.34
WHO IS IT FROM,00:00:01.97
LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LAW OR FINDING A JOG,00:00:03.98
MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN,00:00:02.78
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND,00:00:03.24
NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:04.10
AINK ON A SQUEAL,00:00:02.14
EMEN,00:00:01.44
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW,00:00:05.98
SEEMS LIKE IT HOT TO BE FIXIBLE IN SOFT WARE,00:00:04.25
MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALISE THEIR DESTINIES,00:00:04.99
I WILL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.46
THE EXECUTION WAS CANCELLED,00:00:03.53
CERTAINLY IAM SURE I AM COMFORTABLE,00:00:03.14
THIS IS WHAT I WISHED FOR,00:00:02.04
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY,00:00:03.50
THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL,00:00:03.38
ALL THINGS ARE ONE,00:00:01.94
THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE,00:00:02.90
I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID,00:00:03.41
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:06.98
A HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE,00:00:04.54
AND I'M GOING TO BE OLD THINGS,00:00:03.34
I KNEW THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE,00:00:02.78
WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM,00:00:02.26
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND,00:00:03.98
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVALVED,00:00:06.50
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:11.09
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN THE SAND,00:00:04.03
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND A GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION,00:00:07.66
THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS THAN ONCE,00:00:12.34
WALK IN THE GRASS AND MY BARE FEET,00:00:04.78
THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO,00:00:02.98
IF WE SERVE TEA AND CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND,00:00:05.45
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.26
BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY,00:00:04.61
,00:00:03.91
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:03.05
THERE'S A CARAVAN LEAVING TO DAY FOR AL FALUME,00:00:03.65
VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TEMPT,00:00:03.48
THE HONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF A FEW SCATTERN PINE TREE,00:00:03.77
BEACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START DO ANY DEE,00:00:04.46
IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT,00:00:03.02
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED,00:00:08.04
THE ELECTRICIAN LOOK PUZZLED,00:00:03.74
I BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE,00:00:02.06
SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND,00:00:05.09
THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FILST FALLING STY,00:00:05.02
WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED,00:00:04.90
IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED,00:00:02.38
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT,00:00:02.98
THEY ARE NOT MY SHIP ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTRALIA,00:00:04.73
THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET,00:00:05.28
HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM,00:00:05.26
WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL THE NURSE TOOK AN EXTRA PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS ARM,00:00:05.50
HE WANDERED FAREWELL KEEPING THE DEAD PALMS OF THE ISE'S WITHIN SIGHT,00:00:07.58
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:02.83
HITTING THE DILLY AND ESCAPEKEYS DID NOTHING,00:00:03.82
AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH,00:00:08.59
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED,00:00:03.94
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA,00:00:06.41
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN BAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING,00:00:05.04
THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF THE SORCERERS,00:00:05.14
DID YOU FINISH THE INTERVIEW,00:00:02.47
THEY HAVE THEIR EYES LEWED ON HIS FACE,00:00:09.02
SOMETHING TERRIBLE THIS HAPPENED TO ME,00:00:02.88
I HAD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.94
HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND,00:00:03.94
BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE,00:00:03.29
ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS,00:00:02.50
WHY THE SHOPS STOP AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:05.90
HOW THEY MANAGE TO IMPROVISE THAT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW,00:00:05.90
AND THETS AS THE POE OF LOVE COMES IN,00:00:04.87
THE WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GALL HIS COMPANION ANSWERED,00:00:06.34
HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ARCHIMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN,00:00:11.66
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW,00:00:07.22
EVEN ME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER,00:00:05.18
SO WHAT IS SAIL HIM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE,00:00:07.51
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:03.36
MARIVE OF THE SUN ONE STA,00:00:05.16
THE DESERT DID NOT ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS,00:00:05.14
JANIT ROGER DIED THREE MONTHS AGO,00:00:03.24
AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED,00:00:07.34
WHAT WOULD USE E TO GIVING THEM A JOINT INTEVEW,00:00:03.82
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODDLES IN IT AND SO ON,00:00:04.92
HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DID NMAN HAVE YET,00:00:08.86
WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAD THE HOUR TAKING THE MONEY,00:00:05.59
THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHYMISS HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT,00:00:05.74
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT,00:00:04.20
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GOT INTO BATTLE,00:00:04.18
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY,00:00:05.78
MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED,00:00:03.82
BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER ROBIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO,00:00:05.57
PEOPLELL SAY STRENDOUS THINGS SAID BORBISSO,00:00:03.50
LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT,00:00:06.96
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:03.91
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HOLI CAME BACK LATE FROM THE OFFICE,00:00:03.46
I WANT A DULT THE WORTH OF YOU,00:00:02.38
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE,00:00:03.50
THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS MACKSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME,00:00:06.02
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY,00:00:06.58
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING,00:00:04.56
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SATE ALCHEMIST,00:00:05.14
BENJAMIN WAS SNACKING ON STRIPS OF BACON,00:00:04.42
THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCULARY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DOEDN'T UNDERSTAND THEENNY OF IT,00:00:04.37
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:03.67
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW,00:00:03.00
YOU MAY KISS MY HAND,00:00:03.26
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DAT OF LIGHT,00:00:04.78
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS,00:00:03.10
ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS TO BE SINCERE,00:00:03.96
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:03.12
THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES,00:00:04.34
THE SUN SOARED ABOUTS IT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY,00:00:05.06
THET THOU IT LIKE THERE BUT ALBIN,00:00:03.46
THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER,00:00:02.90
AND SO DO I,00:00:01.90
THE SCALE MODEL OF THE ARCHITECT'S PLAN SAT AT THE CENTRE OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM,00:00:05.42
AND SHOULD DAY BE GARNISHED,00:00:03.34
WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED,00:00:05.42
MY KEYBOARD IS FILLED WITH DUST,00:00:03.00
HE SHOULD RESPECT TRADITION,00:00:02.95
THIS SMANTOTOMI MOVEMENT COSTS YOU FORTUNE,00:00:03.94
I THOUGHT THE INSCURING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:03.10
IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED,00:00:04.68
IT'S A COD SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED,00:00:03.46
I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS,00:00:05.26
MISTER LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW,00:00:02.86
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,00:00:03.02
THEY RAN TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY,00:00:05.71
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME,00:00:04.34
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT,00:00:05.90
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.18
YOU'VE HINTED IT OFTEN ENOUGH,00:00:02.38
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND,00:00:04.58
YOU CAN'T STOP FOR A THING NOW,00:00:03.02
WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS,00:00:02.90
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAKE HIM UP,00:00:01.94
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING,00:00:02.74
IT'S NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMAN,00:00:05.62
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASPHLOTE,00:00:02.18
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP,00:00:03.46
THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK,00:00:04.34
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION,00:00:05.42
AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS,00:00:06.67
THEN A MAN APPROACHED,00:00:03.53
JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER,00:00:04.32
BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE,00:00:06.10
I WENT TO STRETCHIN MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK,00:00:05.02
BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES,00:00:04.58
ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL,00:00:02.28
THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS,00:00:03.53
I'LL JUST WATCH EM HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:04.46
IT RATTLED MENACINGLY,00:00:02.35
THE BOY WANTED TO TAKE HER HAND,00:00:02.45
I HAD THERE EVERYONE HAS GARYBOOSY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN,00:00:05.06
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPAY PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD,00:00:04.90
THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDIGHED TO THE SOLD NOW HELD A WHIG,00:00:06.02
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS,00:00:03.00
IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGN THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:03.02
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY CLEANING HE SAID,00:00:03.43
JUST USE THE PHONE,00:00:02.14
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID,00:00:03.89
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER,00:00:07.22
I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALISED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING,00:00:07.18
I AM GOING WITH YOU THE BOY IS SAID,00:00:05.18
THE EMERALD TAMLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE CALL OF THE WORLD,00:00:03.98
AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE,00:00:04.37
SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPASSIENT,00:00:03.46
WHO AS THUS MAN,00:00:01.92
A SEMING TRANSPARENT OF LAY PROMOTED THE BETAVERSION OF ANENDRIED UP,00:00:05.14
MEANWHILE THE BOY TAUGKT ABOUT HIS TREASURE,00:00:04.70
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF,00:00:02.38
SO HOW WILL WE NAME OISE'S HERRICANES,00:00:04.25
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW,00:00:02.38
MAYBE TO MORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY,00:00:03.94
HE PICKED UP THE TWO STONES AND PUT THEM BACK IN HIS POUCH,00:00:04.30
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND,00:00:02.50
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN,00:00:05.30
WHAT'S THAT OTHER PAPER GOING TO GIVE YOU,00:00:03.14
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS,00:00:06.02
THE CATERPILLAR RESPONDED WITH A NOD,00:00:03.05
WHAT'LL I TELL HIM,00:00:01.90
THE SOB FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE ROPING THEIR BEDROOM WANDOWS,00:00:05.50
THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT,00:00:02.66
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES,00:00:03.79
FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF WAKANCY,00:00:04.92
SOME MEN WERE SMOKING FROM A GIGANTIC PIPE THAT THEY PASSED FROM ONE DOOR FRONE TO THE OTHER,00:00:05.78
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM,00:00:06.91
WE ARE GOING TO GLASCOW YE,00:00:03.24
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO,00:00:02.38
DERA HIS TREASURE,00:00:01.99
A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY,00:00:09.74
DISREGARD MY LAST STATEMENT,00:00:02.74
YOU'LL WATCH THEM AS THEY GROW DEMONSTRATING HOW THE WORLD IS ALWAYS CHANGING,00:00:06.62
THE ART FESTIVAL WAS A DISASTER,00:00:03.62
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:02.86
HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN,00:00:07.70
ANDGHAT NIGHT GEN NO WHY I'M HICKE NAY NOW,00:00:06.19
THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT,00:00:05.45
THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR,00:00:04.13
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED,00:00:01.87
THERE ARE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED,00:00:06.67
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR,00:00:04.34
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:06.24
THA WOTNIS PRECIOUS MAGIPENT,00:00:04.37
IY WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER,00:00:09.02
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES,00:00:04.73
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:10.68
HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND,00:00:04.30
AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED,00:00:05.42
SOME OF THOSE WHOSE SITHES FLIGHT SAY A TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND,00:00:06.53
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY SHE ISN'T HERE,00:00:02.74
BEFORE HIM WAS AN ENORMOUS WHITE HORSE REARING OVER HIM WITH A FRIGHTENING SCREAM,00:00:09.50
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMELL THE WORLD,00:00:03.26
WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT,00:00:05.04
WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN,00:00:04.78
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:03.48
EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND UNDROYED THEM,00:00:04.56
THAT BRINGS YOUR GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS,00:00:03.31
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE,00:00:03.10
AT THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT ATENA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL ITWATER,00:00:07.10
HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW,00:00:04.73
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:02.78
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL,00:00:02.33
ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO,00:00:04.34
SOME MEN MY SMOKING FROM GIGANTIC PIPES THAT THEY PASSED FROM WA TUESY ATE,00:00:06.94
ENDELASTRONG,00:00:03.17
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:04.32
WE'VE BEEN FED BOLOWNE SO LONG WE'RE GETTING USED TO IT,00:00:05.98
THEN WHO ARE YOU,00:00:02.81
GO BACK TO WASHMINGDA CARAVAN SAID,00:00:04.25
BASED ON THE OMENS OF THE PHRASENT,00:00:02.93
SHE REVERSED THE CHARGES,00:00:03.50
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:05.83
HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES,00:00:05.57
LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR,00:00:02.04
WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA,00:00:06.65
AND HE KNEW THAT EGYPT WAS AN EFRICA,00:00:03.70
THINGOGOHOME AND SEE THE FAMILY IS DURING,00:00:02.38
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET,00:00:02.95
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW,00:00:02.66
THE BOY WAS SHAKEN WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHIMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT,00:00:03.22
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:07.90
THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED,00:00:03.12
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SIDRIL OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED,00:00:04.03
TOWN WAS A CASE OF SERIOUS DILURIUM,00:00:02.62
DID YOU BRING THE CHRISTMAS READ,00:00:02.18
BUT YOU ARE A LITTLE GIRL,00:00:01.66
DO YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ME THE MERCHANT ASKED,00:00:05.98
THANKS FOR THE STORY AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR HONEYMOON,00:00:03.79
ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND,00:00:03.34
DID YOU MAKE A SPEECH,00:00:03.10
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY,00:00:04.01
YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW,00:00:02.86
NO ONE CAN BE FROM ANY PLACES THE BOY SAID,00:00:05.88
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS,00:00:06.26
YOU HAVE KILLED YOUR SAGON GAN AT ME,00:00:02.62
LATER WE SIMPLY LET LIFE PROCEED IN ITS OWN DIRECTION TOWARD ITS OWN FATE,00:00:06.72
THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF,00:00:05.21
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THEM WHO TOOK A BIT LONGER TO AWAKEN,00:00:05.38
GIVE ME MY ROBE,00:00:02.64
I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US,00:00:02.66
I DON'T WANT MISSUS DOUGLAS,00:00:03.62
FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS,00:00:26.30
A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.98
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS,00:00:03.50
WHO DO YOU SAY IT WAS,00:00:02.83
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES,00:00:04.10
SHORTY YOU LOOK JOY TROPPING IN THAT CHURSEA,00:00:04.15
WE'RE JUST TRAVEL US THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:02.54
ELIZABETH CHARLES IS DEAD,00:00:03.50
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THESE THINGS COST OVER HERE,00:00:04.46
AIDING AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL,00:00:02.23
AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING,00:00:03.05
BUT CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THEM,00:00:05.62
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP,00:00:04.78
THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD,00:00:05.64
BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED,00:00:03.17
I DON'T SEE A THING,00:00:02.74
THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS,00:00:04.58
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED,00:00:04.51
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM,00:00:03.02
A THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE THEY REACH OF FIND CALLIN TO MALDLS DAN AN SO ALONE,00:00:05.18
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPEN,00:00:02.66
THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:06.02
THE INFIDELS HAD AN EVIL LOOK ABOUT THEM,00:00:03.58
HE STILL HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE DECISION HE HAD MADE,00:00:04.10
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING,00:00:04.22
THE BOY HAD NOTICED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS IRRITABLE AND MISSED HIS BOOKS,00:00:07.13
THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE,00:00:03.38
BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMAR,00:00:03.62
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE,00:00:02.33
THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE,00:00:07.39
WE OWED EVERYBODY IN TOWN,00:00:02.90
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW,00:00:05.30
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL CALLING OF ITS SURFACE,00:00:03.24
WHO YOU HOLTINK ALDON,00:00:03.70
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU HERE AT THIS OASIS FOR A LONG TIME,00:00:05.18
MY FRIEZA CONTAINS ENOUGH FOR A BANQUET,00:00:03.58
WHO ARE YOU HE HEARD A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH,00:00:05.28
IT TURN OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA,00:00:02.90
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PRINTING PLASS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED,00:00:05.35
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BOWN ACROSS THE ROAD,00:00:15.29
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY,00:00:06.62
I USED TO LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN AND ENVY THEM THEIR HAPPINESS,00:00:04.44
I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH,00:00:04.37
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES,00:00:03.98
WE CAN'T LEAVE GRACK HERE,00:00:02.59
AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION,00:00:02.95
IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN,00:00:06.50
HOW LONG IS IT,00:00:01.80
HOW MANY TIMES DEY WON A CALM,00:00:04.42
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP,00:00:04.42
JANIPA'S MAKING OF THE NINE O'CLOCK TRAIN,00:00:04.10
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINOR'S FOO,00:00:04.90
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,00:00:02.81
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN,00:00:03.26
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE,00:00:07.32
YOUR LUCK'S NOT WITH YOU NOW,00:00:02.47
THAT'S GOOD LANDY,00:00:01.87
IT WAS SEEN YEARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD,00:00:05.35
AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE,00:00:05.04
YOU GET OUT AHEAD QUICK,00:00:01.94
BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING I FORGOT TO PACK,00:00:02.26
AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATAMER ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER,00:00:05.69
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND,00:00:04.54
THESE HAVE DISPLACED I SOD ON THE MINEN,00:00:05.18
YOU SHOULD SEE THE ILIGI SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD A FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:04.68
HIS NAME WAS JOSEPH,00:00:02.57
EVERY ONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM,00:00:04.94
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO,00:00:02.57
IAM ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE,00:00:06.82
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD,00:00:04.58
THE ENGINES ROARED AS THE ROCKET LIFTED ITS PRECIOUS CARGO UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE,00:00:07.54
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF OMEN SAID THE BOY,00:00:02.74
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE,00:00:03.74
BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERED TO THE ALCHYMIST,00:00:03.98
MY AGREEMENT WITH YOU GENTLEMENSTANS,00:00:03.74
NICE OF YOU TO COME DOWN,00:00:08.45
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY,00:00:03.02
THE TWO MEN HARIDBAK AND FOUND THE CYNINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION,00:00:04.90
HE REMEMBERED THE SOLLOWO,00:00:03.31
AND SO DO I,00:00:01.66
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:05.30
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND,00:00:04.34
YOU DON'T THINK I'M IN TO TELL,00:00:05.38
NONE THE OCUMIST ANSWERED,00:00:02.95
BUT HE GROUNTED THE TRAVELLERS THREE DAYS,00:00:03.74
YOU GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO WASH THE DIPERS,00:00:03.07
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK,00:00:03.82
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE LEFT,00:00:02.28
THE ENGLISHMEN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN ANY DANGER,00:00:02.93
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT,00:00:04.42
THE ALCHEMIST STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND BENT TO THE GROUND,00:00:05.33
WHAT A WONDERFUL WEATHER,00:00:02.88
HOW DO YOU STOP THIS THING,00:00:02.47
THE LATTER OF THE FOX RIGHT WITHOUT LOOK AT,00:00:02.81
I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT,00:00:04.06
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH A JOURNEY,00:00:08.74
THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS,00:00:05.98
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY,00:00:04.46
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR,00:00:03.89
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:06.00
WHAT SHOULD WE GIVE HIM,00:00:02.54
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE,00:00:03.60
THEN I DON'T GET PAY,00:00:01.90
FORGET IT THERE'S NO SUCH THING,00:00:03.22
THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ,00:00:06.14
SHE TOLD ME SHE FEELS HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC,00:00:03.65
LICARISH IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD,00:00:03.50
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON,00:00:02.23
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPEN,00:00:04.01
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON,00:00:04.70
IT'SGIN A PADASITY ON THE MAP,00:00:02.18
CHRISTOPHER WAS CONFUSED,00:00:01.49
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID HIS SON,00:00:05.04
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:06.31
YOU HAD ME WORRIED,00:00:07.82
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME,00:00:01.90
USE THE EXPORT COMMAND TO SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES,00:00:04.10
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO,00:00:03.67
THIS IS FOR YOU,00:00:02.23
THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW,00:00:02.35
YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID,00:00:05.98
THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO,00:00:02.54
THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE,00:00:04.78
WE MUST STAY HIDDEN,00:00:02.02
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK,00:00:02.59
HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN,00:00:02.74
NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO,00:00:05.62
IF YOU START YOUR EMALES WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH,00:00:05.06
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPADIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE,00:00:06.46
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DONE HIS HEART LEAPT,00:00:04.44
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED,00:00:04.22
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:03.98
FIRST HE HAD STUDIED ESPIRANTO THEN THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS AND NOW IT WAS ALCHEMY,00:00:07.63
THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE,00:00:03.94
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:04.18
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START,00:00:02.54
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS,00:00:08.71
SO WHEN I LOOK OVER YOUR SANDS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HER,00:00:05.66
IT'S STILL SOPPING WET,00:00:02.74
HE SAID THAT EVERYTHING AS IS ON DESTINY,00:00:03.86
A LARGE PEA SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:07.39
AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES,00:00:05.18
SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ANCIENT THAN THE DESERT,00:00:06.26
MY SEVEN YEAR RESIMA GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS,00:00:03.14
THRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT,00:00:06.10
YE WILL GET DONUTS AS A BONUS IF YOU TAKE A SELPHY WITH ME,00:00:04.90
AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED,00:00:04.78
HOW LONG SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER,00:00:02.66
FROM HERON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID,00:00:04.27
THEY WERE SUFFERING FROM HUNGER,00:00:04.90
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE YOU,00:00:02.74
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND,00:00:03.89
I WISH THEY WERE RABBINS,00:00:02.66
HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH,00:00:03.62
THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR,00:00:04.54
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUD,00:00:06.41
YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE ENTIRE SAHARA DESERT SAID THE YOUNG MAN,00:00:05.23
THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS,00:00:07.42
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED,00:00:03.94
THEYR JUST A PILE OF STONES,00:00:02.90
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEAR,00:00:02.62
HOW DO YOU LIKE HER,00:00:03.22
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND A LITTLE ROUND PLANETS,00:00:05.57
THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WIND,00:00:04.13
I COULD HAVE HELPED HER,00:00:01.85
I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID,00:00:07.15
MINE OF HETS IT DOWN,00:00:03.46
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT COULD HAPPEN ONLY TO OTHERS NEVER TO ME,00:00:07.70
SOMETHING'S THE MATTER WITH DADDY,00:00:02.74
I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE,00:00:03.50
WHY HID THE EVERY ONE HIS GARY BUSBY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN,00:00:08.78
IF I AM ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING,00:00:04.94
THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOYS SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT,00:00:04.56
WE'LL HAVE TO SATISFY THEM,00:00:03.10
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,00:00:02.50
HE STILL HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE DECISIONS HE HAD MADE,00:00:03.62
GIVE ME MY ROBE,00:00:02.16
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT,00:00:06.38
THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER,00:00:02.78
LOOKING AT THE SUN HE CALCULATED THAT HE WOULD REACH TARIFA BEFORE MIDDAY,00:00:08.18
YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT,00:00:02.02
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND IY WAS THIRSTY,00:00:03.77
THEY HAV THEIR EYES GLUED ON HIS FACE,00:00:02.66
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY,00:00:05.02
IT WAS STARLIKE AND I EXPLAIN THE SCENES OF THE SAUDIAC TO HER,00:00:04.94
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN AK TO PERFORM A RENAM AC OF PINDNESS,00:00:06.89
IF ONLY WE COULD SEE IT,00:00:02.83
AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED A PHILOSOPHER'S STONE,00:00:03.05
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING,00:00:04.73
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN A COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM,00:00:04.13
THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT,00:00:05.30
HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE,00:00:03.48
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:03.38
AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF,00:00:06.10
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK,00:00:03.60
I AM HERE ANTHE BOY SAID,00:00:03.48
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SA,00:00:03.14
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON,00:00:04.97
GAULS STAND FOR THE LETTER G IN THE NATO PONETIC ALPHABE,00:00:05.86
MAWIVIOF THE SUN ONE STAL,00:00:03.02
HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET,00:00:02.66
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE,00:00:02.26
I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE,00:00:03.50
BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT,00:00:02.95
THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HORRORS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY,00:00:06.02
IT WAS RISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER,00:00:03.86
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON,00:00:07.30
THE CARAVAN MOVED TOWARD THE EAST,00:00:03.26
LOVE IS THE FORCE THAT TRANSFORMS AND IMPROVES THE SOUL OF THE WORLD,00:00:06.12
HIRE SUPERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:05.35
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU,00:00:03.86
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.60
HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHYMIST,00:00:03.86
AS NICE AS BLAKES,00:00:02.66
ONE AFTERN ONE OF HIS SAWINS FELL ER AND EDIPED THAT HERD DEAD,00:00:05.28
TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERS,00:00:04.58
AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING,00:00:03.62
I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT,00:00:03.50
YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT AGEMI,00:00:03.46
MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS,00:00:03.60
HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR,00:00:04.10
THE FURST LOF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET SULK ABOUT IT,00:00:03.36
WHAT DID HE DO WITH HER,00:00:01.46
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE SPEAK SPANISH,00:00:03.86
THE CHILD SOAKED UP IN FORMATION LIKAS PONGE,00:00:05.02
I I WAS TERRIBLY WORRIED,00:00:02.57
THE ADIA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO ENTANCED THAT IT HID THE MEN FROM VIEW,00:00:04.58
STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES,00:00:02.42
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER,00:00:06.22
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS,00:00:04.06
NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE,00:00:04.30
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE BOUGHT A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:07.39
SHE WENT OVER TO MISTER CHERRIT'S HOUSE,00:00:02.98
HANG ON A SECOND,00:00:01.70
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING,00:00:03.38
GET THE LOAD OF THIS,00:00:03.53
HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHIMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN,00:00:05.14
SAOUL WAS INFURIATING THE OTHERS,00:00:03.38
YOU CAN STAY HERE,00:00:04.46
ONLY IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER WITH YOU,00:00:04.68
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.74
I WATCHED THE WEATHER FORECAST,00:00:02.50
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE,00:00:03.31
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOUR,00:00:03.02
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT,00:00:05.54
BUT HE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK,00:00:03.62
WE ARE PART OF THAT SOUL SO WE RARELY RECOGNISE THAT IT IS WORKING FOR US,00:00:07.03
A GARRI TREW DOWN,00:00:02.09
WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE,00:00:04.54
SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE,00:00:05.69
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING,00:00:02.78
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND,00:00:05.26
WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE A SHOW NOW,00:00:04.90
BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE,00:00:06.19
THE ALARM WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE,00:00:03.46
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED,00:00:03.53
WHAT DO THEY WANT,00:00:01.61
WHAT ABOUT HIGGINS AGAINST BECHAN,00:00:02.90
HE'S OUT DUCK SHOOTING NOW,00:00:02.86
THEY WHISKED THEMSELVES INTO A FRENZY,00:00:02.18
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS A FORDABLE ANCOSI,00:00:08.06
TIRD AND DUST EVERYWHERE GIVE ME THE CREW,00:00:03.98
EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER,00:00:08.04
THE ALCHEMIST TAUGHT THE BOY TO PLACE THE SHELL OVER HIS SEAL,00:00:04.66
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:03.19
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PIPO SLEEPING IN PEACE,00:00:05.86
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT,00:00:03.86
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY,00:00:04.90
THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMEN HAD BOUGHT CAMELS AND CLIMBED UNCERTAINLY ON TO THEIR BACKS,00:00:07.42
THE HEAT LASTED UNTILL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET,00:00:05.57
LET'S STOP THIS ANOTHER COMMANDER SAID,00:00:03.98
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR,00:00:03.70
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL,00:00:04.82
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND,00:00:02.38
OH I MYSELF HEARD NOTHINK OF THAT,00:00:04.22
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLELT,00:00:06.07
WHO'S DOWN THERE WITH YOU,00:00:03.24
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED,00:00:09.38
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP,00:00:02.52
IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL,00:00:03.00
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SENT DOWN FOR,00:00:02.86
IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND,00:00:04.58
BUT I'M GOING IN SEARCH OF MY TREASURE THE BOY SAID,00:00:06.79
SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ENCIME THAN ITHER,00:00:04.25
I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT,00:00:03.43
THE SUN WAS VERY HOT THIS SUMMER,00:00:02.42
DON'T YOU LIKE HER,00:00:03.05
AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT,00:00:05.86
WE ARE IN NO HURRY THE CHIEF ANSWERED,00:00:03.26
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU,00:00:01.46
DON'T FIGHT FIRE AT FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP,00:00:02.98
SHE SAID SHE WAS SO EXHAUSTED AND UNHAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT OF LEAVING AND SHE DID,00:00:05.59
GO AND SPEAK TO THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER,00:00:03.77
IF I DON'T FIND IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME,00:00:04.34
THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHORES,00:00:03.65
THEY'VE FILLD THREE SACKS,00:00:05.30
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE,00:00:06.14
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY,00:00:04.90
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH,00:00:03.10
THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING IF WE HAR AT EN TE VECOMTE,00:00:04.39
THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN READER'S EXPECTATIONS CREATED BY THE TEXT AND THE REAL BEHAVIOUR SHOULD BE RESOLVED,00:00:06.70
HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS,00:00:06.38
THE ALCHYMIST ERACED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS,00:00:11.62
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:04.66
FROM HEREON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID,00:00:03.60
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:03.65
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR LUMNAI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS,00:00:05.93
I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET,00:00:03.48
THE TRACK BED ON THIS LAPTOP MEANS CALIBRATING,00:00:03.60
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:03.67
HIS HEART SQUEEZED AS IF HIS CHEST HAD SUDDENLY COMPRESSED IT,00:00:03.70
IT'S GOINE TO PUT OUR CITY ON NO MAP,00:00:03.38
FROM ATOP ITS WALLS ONE CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AFRICA,00:00:05.02
LISTEN TO THAT MOB,00:00:02.57
LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE EMAGIN SAID,00:00:03.96
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US,00:00:03.07
THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER,00:00:04.13
BUT JUST BEFORE LUNCH TIME A BOY STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE SHOP,00:00:06.82
THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE STORY,00:00:05.02
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.36
THE MORNING POST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS,00:00:05.18
SHE PROBABLY WORKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE,00:00:03.02
ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEAD SAT IT,00:00:03.70
THIS IS FOR YOU,00:00:01.87
ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID,00:00:04.56
WHAT'S WORT DINNER TO NIGHT,00:00:02.62
THE BOYS STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME,00:00:06.74
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:03.86
THIS MAN'S GOING TO JUMP AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,00:00:03.55
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:06.26
THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER,00:00:03.10
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MOST FAMILIAR FEATURES,00:00:06.19
THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS,00:00:02.66
I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU,00:00:03.86
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SORE,00:00:05.09
TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE,00:00:06.14
IT WAS GLATRINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND,00:00:05.45
WELL HE FOUR ABOT DEAD THE OLD MAN SAID,00:00:04.44
SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR WILL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE,00:00:04.06
THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL,00:00:03.02
AS I WASHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER,00:00:07.44
THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY,00:00:02.23
MYRIA WAS HILLING IN THUS SO INTLONS THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM YOU,00:00:08.38
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON,00:00:05.40
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK NEIL ABOUT IT,00:00:02.21
THE THOB HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO RUTATE,00:00:03.60
WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE COLLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD,00:00:05.23
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:04.99
AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC,00:00:02.42
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS,00:00:04.82
ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER,00:00:05.38
JEST TELL THEM MARGE SENT YOU,00:00:03.38
IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED,00:00:03.89
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START,00:00:08.90
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FORAINE COUNTRY,00:00:06.10
IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING,00:00:04.99
NO BASELINES OR COMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART IS PROVIDED,00:00:03.98
THEY WERE SPACED OUT AND ROSE THREE FEET APART,00:00:03.46
AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE,00:00:04.42
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES,00:00:02.83
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT RUMOR AND,00:00:02.54
IS THIS THE YEAR YOU CAN'T HEAR ON,00:00:03.38
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN,00:00:05.78
I AM GOING AWAY HE SAID,00:00:02.45
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER,00:00:05.86
BUT HIS HORROT WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS,00:00:04.22
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS WAS TO BE GETTING READY,00:00:04.56
NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT,00:00:08.02
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO,00:00:01.82
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:05.66
BUT THERE THEY SAW A CRYSTAL SHOP THAT OFFERED REFRESHING MINT TEA,00:00:06.46
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD YAT FIGHTIN IS,00:00:07.06
YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELLOR OF THE OASIS,00:00:03.98
SHALL I ANNOUNCE YOU,00:00:02.47
I HAD SAY OH THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:03.82
THIS REQUIRES A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE,00:00:03.19
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE ON THE SHAPE,00:00:04.70
SHE SUNG THE AIR,00:00:01.44
THE SPACE STATION ROCKED VIOLENTLY DUE TO THE INTENSE PRESSURE WAVES FROM THE AIRLOCK FAILURE,00:00:07.06
RELL VEDON TO VICU D'I RITNO DA WEYOSCE,00:00:07.06
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:06.22
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEA,00:00:04.92
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW,00:00:06.58
KEEPIN US A CHANCE PANTIT OFTEN BECAUSE EVERY HEALTHY PERSON HAS TWO OF THEM,00:00:05.18
SHE WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THE THIRD PARTY'S CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY,00:00:05.40
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:06.29
A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES,00:00:03.72
COME ON IN THE OFFICE HERE,00:00:02.62
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVETED AN HOUR,00:00:05.02
THE OLD MAN RETORNED THE ROCK TO THE BOY,00:00:05.76
YOU GIVE THEM EVERYTHING I HAD THE BOY SAID,00:00:05.02
IF WHAT WAN FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTOR IT WILL NOW SPOIL,00:00:06.60
I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID,00:00:03.05
I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL,00:00:03.26
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:08.81
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT,00:00:03.46
IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH,00:00:04.22
THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER,00:00:07.94
WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID,00:00:04.22
I THOUGHT THAT SOME DAY I'D BE RICH AND COULD GO TO MECCA,00:00:04.25
NOBODY'D EVER TELL YOU WHOEVER IT WAS BECAUSE THEY'D BE SCARED,00:00:05.66
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE,00:00:07.13
I SAID GOOD NIGHT,00:00:02.26
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND,00:00:04.54
TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA,00:00:04.54
THERE'S WOMEN A ROCK HAR CHARKS DON'T BE SOOLED,00:00:04.13
AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST,00:00:05.14
YOU'LL BE THE COUNCILLOR OF THE OASES,00:00:04.10
HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN,00:00:05.16
TAKE YI SHIRTON,00:00:01.70
WOOK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE,00:00:03.17
HINYA DRINK,00:00:02.14
HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD,00:00:04.97
THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GISERV FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS AND,00:00:06.50
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE IS BEAKING SPANISH,00:00:03.58
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GRAIN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:09.86
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED,00:00:02.21
THE LIST WAS FRIGHTENINGLY EXTENSIVE,00:00:03.14
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE,00:00:05.14
I WANT MY BABY TO LUKE LIKE YOU,00:00:05.14
I WAS SCERED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGES AND SAND PITS,00:00:05.74
JUDGE MERNARTIN SLOW,00:00:02.66
EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY,00:00:03.00
TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL,00:00:02.30
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED,00:00:04.22
I'VE TRUST IT MORE IN YOUR LIFE FORPARTIN,00:00:04.34
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,00:00:04.44
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER,00:00:05.18
THE MINER HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING TO GO MINING FOR EMERALDS,00:00:05.81
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM,00:00:07.34
DRIGHT AGAIN,00:00:01.06
IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY,00:00:02.40
THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION,00:00:07.37
IT'S GOING TO PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP,00:00:03.14
THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING,00:00:04.42
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:05.18
ON THUS HAVING DE BALGAMA DESIRED TO MAKE GAMPA H,00:00:04.46
THE SNAKE JEDDED VENOM,00:00:02.40
THE BOY WATCHED AS HIS COMPANION WENT TO HIS HORSE AND WITHDREW A SCIMITAR,00:00:05.06
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENTS,00:00:06.38
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:05.90
ABOUT HOW WEALTHY WOULD YOU SAY,00:00:03.12
HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT,00:00:05.40
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE,00:00:02.95
THE THREE FELL SILENT,00:00:03.26
DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR,00:00:05.18
AMASACA FOR THIS COUNTRY,00:00:02.38
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL,00:00:03.14
I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND,00:00:05.30
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY,00:00:06.55
ABOUT TIME ONE OF EULANCATS SAID IT,00:00:02.90
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.13
WITH THIS KIND OF ORGANIZATION I FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO PRIRORITIZE WITHIN A CATEGORY,00:00:09.96
CON THIS MAN ARON IS HERE TISIYER,00:00:09.67
WHEN I'M EETING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT,00:00:03.31
TO NIGHT WE GIVE YOU SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW AND DIFFERENT,00:00:02.86
THIS MAN'S GOING TO JIM AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,00:00:03.94
PARA SITAMAL SHOULD GET RID OF THAT FANE,00:00:05.21
THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMOURED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES,00:00:06.19
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:05.78
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH THET TRANSVERSED STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FEDDEN FROM THE PARPET ROUND,00:00:07.01
IT WAS A USEFUL REMINDER TO COMPLETE THE TASK,00:00:05.74
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING,00:00:03.70
I'VE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID,00:00:03.46
WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT KNOW THE BOY ASKED,00:00:03.98
GO BACK TO WATCHIN THE CARAVAN HE SAID,00:00:03.26
HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH,00:00:05.90
I HAD TO ACT QUICKLY THAT'S RIGHT JUMPDON,00:00:03.43
THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL,00:00:03.29
I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID,00:00:05.66
THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGLUVY AND HENDERSEN HAD LEFT IT,00:00:05.54
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOR SHAPE,00:00:08.30
ALL I SEE IS BET THEM OFF,00:00:03.94
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LAVE IN HOUSES MARE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:06.24
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,00:00:01.70
THE BOY WAS TARTLED,00:00:04.42
I HOPE IT WORKS,00:00:01.46
THIS IS WHY ALCHIME EXISTS THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.98
I DON'T KNOW WHO ANYBODY IS ANY MORE,00:00:03.17
SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,00:00:01.51
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHTS OF THE MINE,00:00:04.03
YOU FIGHTED KAT,00:00:02.38
WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN ON SOME SWEET JAMS,00:00:02.74
NEVER MIND DOLSGEIS,00:00:02.90
THE TERROR WAS PALPABLE,00:00:02.98
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH,00:00:02.59
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:06.14
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING BEFORE THOSE REPORTES GET BACK,00:00:05.98
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,00:00:06.26
JONATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY,00:00:03.19
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARAPHA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS,00:00:05.45
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE JUNE,00:00:02.98
ADVANCING SLOWLY THEY SURGED AMONG THE STORMS,00:00:05.40
CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW,00:00:04.46
IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED,00:00:07.99
EVERYTHING I SAY IS RIGHT,00:00:02.30
AMBLID OF A TAFFLAS SAN TE FLOI THAT MAN ANBI MY AFTER,00:00:06.55
WHENEVER HE COULD HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL,00:00:04.87
WHO'D YOU SAY WAS GOING TO GET EM,00:00:01.61
WHO DO YOU WANT,00:00:01.73
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY,00:00:03.96
YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT EASY,00:00:02.16
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT,00:00:04.18
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREEN BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD,00:00:05.02
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING,00:00:05.78
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,00:00:08.42
I THOUGHT THE AUNT SCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:03.02
ALGUS GO UPSTAIRS AND SENT IT OVER WITH A MESSENGER,00:00:03.50
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE,00:00:05.88
IT WAS HA SECOND OR THIRD TIME THEY TRIED,00:00:03.58
MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS,00:00:03.12
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER,00:00:04.46
AND THEIR EYES SPOKE OF DEATH,00:00:02.62
THERE IS NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD,00:00:04.92
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT,00:00:02.78
LIFE ATTRACTS LIFE THE OLCHIMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.46
HAVE HER CALL ME BACK,00:00:03.43
WILL YOU HELP ME,00:00:02.74

TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED,00:00:05.66
THE CONQUERED HALF OF THE WORLD ON HER HERSES BACK,00:00:03.22
SHE HAD NO TEMPERATURE,00:00:02.26
THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE,00:00:06.98
SHE KNOWS IT TOO,00:00:01.58
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY,00:00:06.38
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT,00:00:02.26
TANGIR IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA,00:00:02.95
AND I'D BETTER READ YOUR BOOKS SAID THE BOY,00:00:06.34
MY NAME IS BED DAVID,00:00:02.42
HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOONES,00:00:05.06
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK,00:00:04.58
AND THERE I SPOKE OF DEATH,00:00:02.30
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS,00:00:05.42
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WEEL ENDS FOR WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID,00:00:05.50
THE DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE,00:00:02.66
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:03.38
HE WAS TENSE AND UPSET BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT,00:00:05.86
CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW,00:00:04.06
WHY DARES OCEANS OF ROOM HERE,00:00:03.22
WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE ONE,00:00:02.74
TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S SIMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:05.81
SARA CAN YOU READ ME,00:00:03.17
SHE TOLD ME TO WRITE A PLAY FOR TO NIGHT,00:00:03.14
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE,00:00:06.00
I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP,00:00:04.46
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS,00:00:02.81
AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS,00:00:04.85
READING BETWEEN THE LINES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING,00:00:03.48
THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO CALL,00:00:05.18
I JUST WANT A DREAM ABOUT MAICA,00:00:03.19
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES,00:00:03.74
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.22
AFTER WRITING A BUG REPORT ONE SHOULD REGULARLY CHECK IF SOME ONE RESPONDED,00:00:04.90
AND YOU MERRIT HER,00:00:02.47
LIGHTHOUSES IN FOGGY WORLD,00:00:03.38
LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID,00:00:05.23
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE,00:00:03.82
I AIN'T GOINE A SQUEAL,00:00:01.58
WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE,00:00:03.38

I AM JUST A MAN FOR WANDERERS IS A DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SADES ALCHEMISTS,00:00:06.02
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS,00:00:06.50
BE SURE YOU SPELLED THE NAME RIGHT,00:00:02.54
I MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:03.31
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME,00:00:04.25
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED,00:00:02.86
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A SNAKE,00:00:02.76
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IND TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE,00:00:04.20
THE TRAIN LINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW,00:00:03.38
I FELT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE,00:00:03.34
IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINENESS,00:00:02.26
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALK BACK TO MY HOME E MA BORY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPY,00:00:05.93
YO HONO HATELESS OUTSIDE,00:00:04.27

I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE,00:00:09.70
THENK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING,00:00:03.65
SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE,00:00:05.38
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION THE DISTANCE CAME THE SCEND OF TREMS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:05.95
PLEASE BRING MAMMA BACK,00:00:02.26
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT,00:00:03.29
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED,00:00:03.86
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT,00:00:03.10
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME TING,00:00:04.58
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:06.38
MAY I GO AND SEE HIM,00:00:02.64
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS,00:00:04.01
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED,00:00:03.62
THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY,00:00:02.50
THE PRIEST COLLAPSED BACKWARDS,00:00:02.62
THE LAVANDER INCREASED IN INDAN CITY,00:00:03.67
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH,00:00:03.86
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE,00:00:03.91
I AM ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE,00:00:02.23
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY,00:00:05.45
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,00:00:02.18
WE ARE IN NO HURRY THE CHIEF ANSWER,00:00:04.34
COURCH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT,00:00:03.50
DON'T TRY TO MOVE,00:00:02.11
ISN'T THIS A PAROMETER OF THE METHOD,00:00:02.30
HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION,00:00:06.58
WHICH ONE OF THESE MEN IS IT,00:00:04.80
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID,00:00:03.02
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP,00:00:02.57
THEN WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORTS OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:05.42
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE,00:00:02.42
WE ALWAYS OBSERVED THE TRADITION,00:00:02.62
I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ARCHIMISTS DARCHIMIST CONTINUED,00:00:03.77
WHAT'LL IT TAKE TILL THE BANK REOPENS,00:00:03.89
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPORT FIRST,00:00:03.38
DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE HERE WHO CURES PEOPLE'S ILLNESSES THE BOY ASKED,00:00:06.02
MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS,00:00:03.26
FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING WAS DARK AND SCARY,00:00:04.06
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR ME A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WINNING,00:00:06.84
IT WAS TARM BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY,00:00:05.40
THE TALK WAS SO DRATEFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FON,00:00:05.69
SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER,00:00:03.74
WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION,00:00:04.68
ALBERT DIDN'T HAVE A BROTHER,00:00:02.21
I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT,00:00:03.10
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS,00:00:04.73
AND YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO,00:00:03.86
WITH THE WARS BETWEEN THE TRIBES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE DESERT,00:00:18.48
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES AND TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE,00:00:05.98
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID,00:00:02.90
IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE,00:00:04.18
YOU COULD HAVE DIED AFTER PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED,00:00:04.10
THEY FORGET THAT LEAD COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFIL,00:00:06.34
I'M HERE THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.02
NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL RICH,00:00:04.08
NO HE RUS SIXTY DAYS ONDES,00:00:02.90
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS,00:00:05.14
HE BROUGHT SIX SHEEP WITH HIM,00:00:05.11
THE LAVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY,00:00:03.46
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE,00:00:05.04
IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT,00:00:06.50
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING,00:00:03.60
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID,00:00:03.05
ONLY REALIZED THAT HAD BEEN DESTRUCTIVE FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD,00:00:04.70
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT,00:00:02.88
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START,00:00:02.78
IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:03.96
HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN SAID BUT OFFERING SOMETHING HE DIDN'T HAVEN A HAVE YET,00:00:06.26
ITS CANDIS NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON,00:00:06.55
EVEN THE GUIDES SPOKE VERY LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER,00:00:05.30
IT'S A SIMPLE STORY,00:00:02.30
SHE'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND,00:00:04.70
ED CONSURUS THEIR HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME,00:00:06.10
THEY ENJOYED THE SILENCE,00:00:02.78
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PET,00:00:04.10
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SOON BE HAPPENING,00:00:05.47
HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE,00:00:04.13
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED,00:00:03.65
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING,00:00:05.30
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FILLED WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:04.80
MY TEXTNA LOFE PAY FOR THE OF ITS SCHOOL PROBLES,00:00:04.08
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE,00:00:03.70
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY,00:00:03.34
WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT,00:00:04.66
NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELLERS,00:00:05.26
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:02.90
WHERE'S THE OLD GOULD,00:00:02.62
THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY,00:00:02.76
WE ARE JUST TRAVELERS THE ICAMIST ANSWERED,00:00:03.07
HIGH AS TWO PERSONAL TRAIN IS AND MAKES ONE OF THEM TRAIN YELLOW ONE,00:00:05.78
I AM SURPRISED THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.38
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG,00:00:02.86
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINOLS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROOV,00:00:05.30
YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW,00:00:02.42
IT MEANS MY JOB,00:00:04.10
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:03.14
BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS MEW FRIEND,00:00:04.08
THET GONTO BE GENTLE TO SIDME,00:00:04.06
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID,00:00:04.42
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT,00:00:03.67
HE HAD NOT A SCENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FATE,00:00:04.18
HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE HAD BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERY THING INTO GOWD,00:00:10.03
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETELIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY,00:00:08.09
HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO,00:00:05.88
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP,00:00:04.46
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:04.58
DE MONEY IS UNEMPARTANT,00:00:03.10
THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK,00:00:03.98
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS O LONDON,00:00:04.94
HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER,00:00:04.66
IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG,00:00:02.50
YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET,00:00:02.98
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM,00:00:05.86
DOTRIBALD CHEFTAINE CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD,00:00:06.62
NEXT TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY,00:00:03.02
IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL,00:00:04.20
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT THAT'S GREAT NOW ONE,00:00:09.26
BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES,00:00:09.38
PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE SOUGHED,00:00:03.67
I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING,00:00:06.89
THE FINK ITSELF AS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND,00:00:04.42
VENUS IS FAR TOO HOT FOR EXPLORATION,00:00:03.24
OGLFI TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE'D SEEN,00:00:03.34
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:07.54
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP,00:00:07.42
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY,00:00:05.18
AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS,00:00:04.82
THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE,00:00:02.78
AND SHE ALREADY HAS HER TREASURE IT'S YOU,00:00:04.06
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID,00:00:03.43
HE WAS OLDER AND CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET,00:00:03.50
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY,00:00:04.42
FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK,00:00:06.43
WHAT'S DANCE,00:00:01.82
HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANTED IT TO DE MONK,00:00:05.74
BETWEEN ROAST BEEF AND POTATOES HOW CAN WE LOSE,00:00:03.26
IT WAS A COBERE WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES,00:00:04.01
I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE ANAWA,00:00:03.14
WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE,00:00:07.54
HOWDO YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN,00:00:02.90
THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU WILL TRY TO IGNORE THEM,00:00:07.58
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON,00:00:03.62
I FIND THE OTHER ARGUMENT DUBIOUS,00:00:03.10
THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT,00:00:03.94
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED,00:00:04.85
YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME,00:00:03.19
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE,00:00:01.99
YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER,00:00:03.89
IM IT DOTH BEAUTIFUL,00:00:03.24
THEY WERE MEN OF A DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS,00:00:04.78
HE SAT LOOKING AT DUSKAI FOR A WLONG TIME,00:00:04.22
A FIFTH CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER,00:00:05.62
I DON'T LIKE COCOANUTS,00:00:05.69
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH,00:00:03.10
THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME,00:00:04.10
AN ASAY MAYBE YOU BO FAVID,00:00:04.44
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE MINE,00:00:04.99
THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHARES,00:00:03.53
HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT,00:00:04.70
MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU,00:00:02.42
THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID,00:00:05.90
H FEMEL IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,00:00:02.69
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND,00:00:04.70
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA,00:00:06.02
DROP THE WHOLE BUSINESS QUICKLY,00:00:03.65
HE JUST CALLED A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTDAY,00:00:04.49
THESE HATPHOMS PLAYED MUSIC VERY CLEARLY IN MY EARS,00:00:04.92
I'VE JUST SWORN IN FOUR HUNDRED DEPUTIES,00:00:03.07
I AM GOING INTO THE DESERT MAN ANSET TURNING BACK TO HIS READING,00:00:05.06
THAT'S WHAT I DID BEFORE Y MARRIED CHARLES,00:00:03.98
THE DRIVER GOT KNOCKED COLD,00:00:02.90
ETSE OISSIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER,00:00:03.26
THE LETTER AIN'T WORTH NOTHING,00:00:02.30
WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSOL THE ARRAS ASK,00:00:05.74
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH,00:00:03.07
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY,00:00:08.06
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:02.88
BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY,00:00:02.76
I'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE 'S UP TO,00:00:02.26
A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME,00:00:03.34
I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS,00:00:04.92
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE,00:00:03.05
STILL AFTER THAT FIRST MILLION BEFORE YOU ARE THORT IT,00:00:04.06
THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK,00:00:02.06
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE,00:00:04.63
TO DAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE,00:00:07.46
WHO DO YOU WANT,00:00:02.62
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE,00:00:03.22
THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAKE TO MY WEAT,00:00:06.67
AND FINALLY THE FALCAN RETURNED WITH THEM EL,00:00:04.10
LATS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAID,00:00:04.68
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TERIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS,00:00:07.22
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH HA RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TE BIRDS,00:00:05.02
DOT BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.19
BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS T ON AN OPPORTUNITY,00:00:04.49
AT THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER,00:00:06.38
THIS COM BE STRENCED ENOUGH I AM INNOCENT HE CRIED DESPERATELY,00:00:04.34
I WANT A FLOWER,00:00:02.38
THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION,00:00:02.93
TISCOP IS MADE OF POLIS STEREM,00:00:04.10
THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY,00:00:06.02
WE'LL LEAVE TO MORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHYMUST'S ONLY RESPONSE,00:00:07.03
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING,00:00:05.18
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY,00:00:03.55
MY FATHER NOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IT,00:00:02.42
AN WHAT DO YOU DOIN SALEM HE INSISTED,00:00:03.22
YO THEY MIGHT EVEN THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOVED RAW FOR CONVERSATION NO,00:00:10.75
LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING THE JOB,00:00:06.10
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU,00:00:02.74
HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER,00:00:02.52
BUT MAYBE I NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT,00:00:04.30
THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN,00:00:05.64
FINODETT AND PIARIOSTRIT,00:00:03.86
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE,00:00:01.97
AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PULL OUT THE ROCKS HE ENCOUNTERED HE HEARD FOOTSTEPS,00:00:05.86
HE'S ON THE WAY,00:00:02.38
I NEVER KNEW HE HAD A DIER,00:00:01.94
AND TO MORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE PART OF BOD SOUL,00:00:03.98
I' BEEN STRY THE FIGUR UH,00:00:02.74
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HORROR,00:00:04.25
THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN,00:00:06.22
NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMMEN SCARRIED THROUGHOUD THE BOUNGRIES AT ALPARN,00:00:08.14
AND HE CAME DOWN AFTER THE GAME WITH THE CONTRACT,00:00:03.79
ID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE TO MORRA THAT GUN,00:00:03.34
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED,00:00:03.38
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT PRETTY FEW PEOPLEMEN BOAT,00:00:04.54
WHEN YOU FIND A BOCK IN SOFTWARE PLEASE REPORT IT,00:00:03.98
IT SEEMS SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL,00:00:03.10
THANKS FOR DROPPING AROUND,00:00:02.76
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE WERE LIKE THAT,00:00:04.46
I BEG OF YOU NOTH TO DO THIS SONG,00:00:04.78
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START,00:00:03.38
SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHAME YOG AND HE WALKED INTO POLISE OFFICE,00:00:04.46
THE CHARCOAL BURNT AWAY TO WHITE ASH,00:00:03.86
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK DREVE FORWARD AN INCH OR SO,00:00:06.82
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE,00:00:03.89
STILL I'VE NO IDEA HOW TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY REPEATED,00:00:04.13
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED,00:00:06.86
BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED,00:00:03.82
AT MOSE THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER MITROID HAD DESCENDED,00:00:04.44
WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIPAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID,00:00:05.66
HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HALL,00:00:04.78
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED,00:00:03.55
THEY PLANCED IT IN A WOODEN BOX AND LEFT IT THERE FOR GOOD,00:00:05.26
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF FRANCE LEADING I TO THE HOUSE,00:00:04.18
YOUR HUSBAND MUST HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT HURRY,00:00:02.42
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT,00:00:03.34
WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED,00:00:05.02
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED,00:00:02.59
TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S IMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHINIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.90
THE PASHAN WAS SOFT AND INWITENING,00:00:02.86
SHE PLACED OLEM AND TOMMEM IN THE CHEST,00:00:05.90
I DONE MY BEST,00:00:02.66
SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER,00:00:02.93
JUPITER HAS A GREAT RED SPOT,00:00:02.06
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.15
ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:03.00
AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN,00:00:02.66
I'LL NEVER GET THIS SPEECH RIGHT,00:00:02.26
THERE WAS A FOURTH FIRE IN LOS ANGELES,00:00:02.81
I'S NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD,00:00:03.14
ABOUT ELEVEN I WOKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING,00:00:05.83
THANK YOU SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.10
IS THE HEAD BETTER,00:00:02.02
HOW COULD IT BE OLQUED,00:00:02.42
HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES,00:00:05.69
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED,00:00:05.02
HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF A SUCH IMPORTANCE TO A SHEPHERD,00:00:07.58
MY DROB REQUIRES A LOT OF CRAVELLING,00:00:03.58
BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RAGNOW,00:00:04.34
HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN,00:00:03.10
I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR THIS HAPPENS,00:00:02.88
I ENCOURAGE EVERY ONE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICE TO PROJECT COMMON VOICE,00:00:06.00
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE SHEEP ARE AFRAID OF STRANGERS,00:00:06.62
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP,00:00:05.52
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE,00:00:02.78
HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF,00:00:02.66
I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I HAVE SOMETHING,00:00:10.25
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN,00:00:09.10
WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS,00:00:03.94
HE'S INSANE OR DRUNK OR SOMETHING,00:00:02.78
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING,00:00:06.34
YOU CARLED THE FAMBER NOT TEN MINUTES AGO,00:00:03.62
THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERYONE STOO,00:00:02.54
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY OF METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES,00:00:08.26
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO,00:00:03.10
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE,00:00:07.01
AND I AM SERTAN YOU WILL FIND IT THE ARCHIMIS SAID,00:00:04.34
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELLOR,00:00:05.52
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET,00:00:06.12
IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWORD WITH ITS TRANSPARENT FLASK HIDDEN ON TOP,00:00:06.26
I DIDN'T FALL IN,00:00:01.87
CAN I AT LEAST KEEP THE ONION SOUP,00:00:04.99
HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET,00:00:03.38
THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS,00:00:04.34
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY,00:00:06.96
WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT,00:00:04.34
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA,00:00:05.54
IT WAS A FATO JEC FLYING BETWEEN THE BOLDENS,00:00:06.14
KEEP HIS SHIRT ON,00:00:02.42
THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE POCK,00:00:03.26
SOMEBODY PUSHED AGAINST ME AND I ALMOST FELL INTO THE DITCH,00:00:05.14
SO WHAT IS SALUM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE,00:00:06.58
FROM THEN ON THE BOY UNDERSTOOD HIS HEART,00:00:04.94
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE SIGN AT ERS TOO LYING IN THE SAME POSITION,00:00:04.87
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:07.87
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:06.72
MY FATHER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM,00:00:03.02
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:02.78
I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY,00:00:02.59
HE JUST TOOK OVER THE BANK,00:00:02.83
THE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED,00:00:05.18
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD,00:00:06.60
BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXALTED,00:00:03.26
THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.63
THE AUTOR'S ATTENTIVE FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY,00:00:04.75
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME WAN THE CLOUD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:05.06
BY INIMERATINGS OF PEOPLE SHE WANTED TO TALK WITH SHE WAS CALMED,00:00:04.42
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHYMUS TENT WITH THE HORSE,00:00:05.59
AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS HE CAN,00:00:03.41
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,00:00:08.28
THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM EGYPT HE WOULD BUY THAT SWORD,00:00:05.90
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WARD OF MOTH HE THOUGHT,00:00:05.14
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING,00:00:03.43
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOODFORT YOU'VE LEARNT THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE,00:00:03.94
BUT PICKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERD,00:00:03.53
BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE,00:00:04.46
IT SHOULD PROVIDE RESULTS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE OF THE ART,00:00:06.29
THERE WAS NO NEED TO INQREASON THEN THE ARABIS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THE HORACES,00:00:08.86
WHAT WE NEED IS FIREWORKS,00:00:02.57
CAN I GO NOW,00:00:01.46
TWINS ARE KNOWN TO BE CONFOUNDING,00:00:02.54
IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING,00:00:07.61
AS JENEFER WALKED DOWN THE AISLE SHE WONDERED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE,00:00:07.10
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE,00:00:01.82
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE,00:00:04.68
IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE,00:00:05.38
THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TIPPED TO MY WEE,00:00:06.00
THE BOY'S NAME WAS FANTIABBLE,00:00:03.70
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY,00:00:03.50
OL THIS HEATING BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:07.30
OF COURSE IT IS,00:00:03.94
AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU,00:00:03.10
IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS,00:00:04.82
DO IT FOR THE PAPER,00:00:02.42
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:03.34
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT,00:00:04.30
THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO LIT THE BALL,00:00:03.55
I CAN ALWAYS GO ABACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:03.98
IT RATTLED MENACINGLY,00:00:02.18
THE OLD MAN LEAPED THROUGH THE BROOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO,00:00:04.42
I STILL SAY THAT THIS DRONDO PERSON IS A MOUTH,00:00:05.18
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT,00:00:03.62
I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.39
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLEN OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE,00:00:03.62
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE DURING THE BLACKMITH WIT PATCHES OF GUINO CREAMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:07.51
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED,00:00:02.69
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T,00:00:03.07
NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW,00:00:05.06
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING,00:00:04.42
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY SHE WAS KILLED,00:00:03.62
BUY TACKS DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONGS,00:00:04.97
THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THIS WEEK DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL,00:00:04.30
YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING,00:00:04.27
TO DAY'S WORLD IS FULL OF COMMERCIALS,00:00:03.02
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT,00:00:01.70
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:06.14
HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES,00:00:03.74
THE FIRST RULE DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:05.26
UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE IMONDS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD,00:00:05.50
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS,00:00:04.56
THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY,00:00:05.18
THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE,00:00:05.16
A LITTLE LEMON GRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP,00:00:05.33
AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT,00:00:03.34
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA,00:00:11.02
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ONE OF THE FIGURES DEMANDED,00:00:04.46
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY,00:01:00.79
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,00:00:01.49
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND WI WAS THIRSTY,00:00:03.79
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVANTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR,00:00:11.78
ZIS ISN'T A CATNABA,00:00:03.48
I HATE TO THINK THAT I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BUT I GUESS THAT'S NOT REALLY UP TO ME,00:00:06.10
IT CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FIDERABILITY BEGIT OF LUCK,00:00:04.30
IF HE WERE TO FET ON TIME HE WOULDN'T CRY,00:00:02.54
I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT,00:00:04.70
IN HIS HAND HE GRASPED A SNAKE BY THE TAIL,00:00:04.46
I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET,00:00:01.85
THE TRAIN LINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW,00:00:03.98
THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY,00:00:04.58
HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOONES,00:00:04.46
WHERE ARE YOU FROM THE BOY ASKED,00:00:02.71
YOU FORGET THE POWER THAT ALWAYS WATCHES OVER THE MORNING POST,00:00:05.16
HAVEN'T YOU EVEN STARTED,00:00:02.78
HE SAW THE BOY APPEARED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF SHEDUNES,00:00:04.42
THIS MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY,00:00:02.30
WELL THE THEY HAD COLLEGE GIRL FRARE SCHOOLOF CONMALISAM,00:00:04.06
LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING A JOB,00:00:04.30
AND HE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY,00:00:02.66
TEBOY TROW HIS HORS CLOSER,00:00:02.74
WHAT'S SO DEPRESSING ABOUT THAT,00:00:01.94
THE WOMAN SAT DOWN AND TOLD HIM TO BE SEATED THIS WELL,00:00:03.53
IT'S SATURDAY IT'S HAT I RALLY WANT TO TRY IN TE DRYA RUMMIN,00:00:05.62
I'M UPSET THAT THEY GET TO HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD WHILE ACTING LIKE THERANDAGE,00:00:04.94
A BREEZE BEGAN TO BALL,00:00:01.78
YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY,00:00:04.37
SEVERAL FIGURES APPROACHED HIM,00:00:02.86
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDELSON'S HOUSE,00:00:05.76
BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHYMIST SAID TO THE MONK,00:00:07.06
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY I WAS TIRED,00:00:04.70
THE THIEF WASN'T THERE AND THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA,00:00:05.06
EZAF TA DAMANI,00:00:02.54
CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW POLITICIANS ARE,00:00:02.69
IS THIT ANY GOOD,00:00:02.21
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP,00:00:07.78
THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH,00:00:05.78
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH,00:00:02.74
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:03.41
CATHERINE WALKED ALONGSIDE THE CANAL,00:00:04.70
WHY THE SHOT STOPPED AFTER THE THINTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:07.03
THE REST OF YOU GET IN HERE AND RIOT,00:00:03.86
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC A THARG AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP,00:00:05.66
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RAT AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED,00:00:04.82
IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS,00:00:03.98
THE BURNING FIRE HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:03.26
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:05.81
THE SNAKE FOUGHT FRANTICALLY MAKING HISSING SOUNDS THAT SHATTERED THE SILENCE OF THE DESERT,00:00:06.17
BUT NOW THE SOUNDS IN SIGHT HAD STOPPED,00:00:02.28
MARGOOD LOOK TELEGRAMS,00:00:02.38
ONLY IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER WITH YOU,00:00:04.42
AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING,00:00:03.14
IT WAS THE OLD MAN WHO SPOKE FIRST,00:00:02.90
AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPECH OF THE PROJECTILE,00:00:06.10
THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT,00:00:03.94
AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE,00:00:02.18
I'M GOING TO,00:00:03.26
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS,00:00:04.54
THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED,00:00:03.38
ISN'T IT ALL TOO WONDERFUL,00:00:05.28
HE'S TRYING TO TREAT YOU AGAIN,00:00:02.45
THE FIRST RULE OF DONG FY CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,00:00:03.55
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SEDDENED HE WAS HAPY,00:00:03.62
COULD HAVE BEEN UN MY WAD TO OLD DOCK BROWN,00:00:02.42
FEAR IS OFTEN THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE,00:00:03.22
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING,00:00:01.58
FELLA RANTZ THE FEBRUARY MONTHS,00:00:04.22
HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.32
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE,00:00:04.58
THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS INE COULD SEE AND HE WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE,00:00:07.27
THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY,00:00:04.39
DID YOU KNOW THAT CABIN MARCHUS IS BACK FROM SCHOOL,00:00:04.06
THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JOB HE SAID,00:00:04.58
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND,00:00:03.98
THE SPACE QUICKLY FILLED WITH PEOPLE,00:00:02.95
WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED,00:00:03.14
HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER,00:00:03.60
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON,00:00:13.97
MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T DERILLY HIS DREAM,00:00:03.50
IN HIS HAND HE GRASPED A SNIKE BY THE TILE,00:00:04.32
BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM,00:00:03.84
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT,00:00:02.59
WHEN YOU START TO EAT LIKE THIS SOMETHING IS THE MATTER,00:00:04.01
IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME,00:00:04.56
WE'LL HAVE TO SATISFY THEM,00:00:02.66
HE MOVED ABOUT AND VISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:04.46
IS THE HEAD BETTER,00:00:02.18
THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD,00:00:03.38
HE NCOUNTED ME UNDER ONE CONDITION,00:00:02.78
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WORKING,00:00:05.54
YOU WON'T MISS ANYTHING,00:00:03.94
WASN'T THAT A SWELL STORY WE GAVE YOU,00:00:03.50
AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE,00:00:03.36
GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE THRONE,00:00:02.40
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND ROTTLES IN IT AND SO ON,00:00:05.74
THE VOYS WON'T END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID,00:00:04.08
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:05.78
IT'S UP THERE,00:00:01.63
EVERY ONE ON EARTH HAS A TREASURER THAT AWATES HIM HIS HEART'S AKED,00:00:11.57
ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER,00:00:03.10
IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE,00:00:02.69
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM HE BRAIN,00:00:06.96
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE,00:00:03.14
THIS IS CHRISTMAS EVE,00:00:02.50
I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID,00:00:04.30
THE ITALIAN GOT HOWORTS MIXED UP,00:00:02.62
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT,00:00:04.78
IF YOU KNOW OF OTHER GAMES THAT PLAY WELL WITH HENCE FREE CONTROL PLEASE POST IT IN THE COMMENS,00:00:07.10
WHENEVER IT GOLD HE SOUGHT OUT O NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL,00:00:05.33
HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY,00:00:02.98
THEN WHO'S THIS ONE,00:00:02.98
HE'S RIGHT IN MY OFFICE THERE,00:00:03.34
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP,00:00:05.18
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HER LIFE HAD BEEN DELATED,00:00:03.98
THE NURSE WADDLED AROUND THE WARD,00:00:03.70
EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN NOW CLOSING THE JOURNAL HE WAS READING,00:00:06.24
BUSINESS IS REALLY IMPROVED HE SAID TO THE BOY AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAD LEFT,00:00:05.16
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID,00:00:04.58
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.14
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER BE WITH A SHEEP WHO DON'T SAY ANYTHING,00:00:03.58
THE BUILDER PLACED THE BRICK ONTO THE PLANK OF WOOD SO IT WOULD BEND INTO SHAPE,00:00:08.18
IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED,00:00:02.66
MUST HAVE BEEN THE JAMP AND THE COLD WATER,00:00:02.57
I LEARN HOW TO CARE FOR SHEEP AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW THAT'S DONE,00:00:06.29
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.98
HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR,00:00:05.50
I FEEL I OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF HER,00:00:03.98
SOME DO COME BACK,00:00:02.64
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:05.93
SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED,00:00:05.64
I THOUGHT TO NIGHT I'D PUT MISS KELLEY THERE,00:00:03.10
THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION,00:00:06.12
BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHALL RETURN YOUR LOVE,00:00:03.86
AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART,00:00:04.82
EVIDENTLY WE'RE THE FLOOR SHOW,00:00:02.64
AND I'M AFRAID WE WANT IT BACK,00:00:04.25
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SANPETS,00:00:08.26
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:07.10
THE ALCHYMISTS KNOCKED ON THE GATE OF THE MONASTERY,00:00:08.42
I HAVE THAT FRIGHT HERE,00:00:02.14
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELLOR,00:00:06.10
THE BREAK FLUID WAS LEAKING OUT INTO THE PATHS,00:00:04.34
HER MANIPULATION FAILED,00:00:02.26
IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR,00:00:04.54
TREASON'S HAVE BLOWN THAT COMES INESPECTEDLY,00:00:03.29
THAT WAS HIS WORK,00:00:04.82
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY,00:00:02.74
STRANGE AVEGIES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND,00:00:03.12
IT'S ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THEALCHEMIST SAID,00:00:09.96
THE BOY PREFERRED WINE,00:00:02.42
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD,00:00:03.34
THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SAVE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMALK,00:00:07.25
BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON,00:00:05.09
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE,00:00:02.30
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN,00:00:02.62
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,00:00:02.98
WHO'S GOINE GET EM,00:00:01.66
THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS PEACEFUL VERSES,00:00:05.42
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN,00:00:03.74
SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND,00:00:03.62
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:03.89
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING,00:00:03.55
HOW LONG IS IT,00:00:02.66
THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DON'T REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE,00:00:09.14
THE BOY SAID NOTHING,00:00:02.78
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA,00:00:06.19
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST,00:00:04.32
THE GITTAR BROKEAND SHE COULDN'T PLAY ANY MORE,00:00:03.26
THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION,00:00:04.70
THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED,00:00:06.17
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME,00:00:03.26
LISTEN TO THAT MORE,00:00:07.70
MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE,00:00:04.18
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:02.88
THE CLOCK WAS SLIGHTLY ASCUE,00:00:03.02
IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF MY WEBBROWSER COULD SYNCRONIZE ALL ITS PREFERENCES NOT JUST SOME,00:00:06.17
THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING,00:00:03.72
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN,00:00:08.78
HE QUICKLY POLRED HIS HANDS AWAY,00:00:02.57
TWONOLIVER AND JOIN OPADI,00:00:03.67
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:02.59
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS,00:00:04.82
THE BOYS HEARD NOTHING,00:00:02.57
IN A WEEK'S TIME WE ARE GOING TO AMERICA,00:00:03.60
THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:03.98
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO,00:00:08.47
WHATULD BE NEXT TO IM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SAD,00:00:04.51
I NEEDED IMMEDIATE EXCESS,00:00:01.97
I POINTED OUT MASS BRIDE DUT OF LI,00:00:03.26
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY,00:00:03.36
HE WAS MORE CERTAIN OF IT THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,00:00:03.98
THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER,00:00:03.65
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION,00:00:07.37
AND HE WASN'T FARY MUCH BETTER,00:00:03.89
I DIDN'T FORN IN,00:00:02.18
I WAS IN BORN YESTERDAY,00:00:02.62
I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK,00:00:03.38
HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT,00:00:04.70
IT'S ALWAYS NICE IF YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING NEW ISN'T IT,00:00:03.94
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING,00:00:02.42
TAKE HOLD OF DE COVER,00:00:03.70
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAL HIM,00:00:03.67
MOTHER IS COMING WITH US ON THE TRAIN,00:00:03.58
THAT'S TRUE THE BOY FOUGHT,00:00:02.90
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE,00:00:02.50
ALWAYS HEA THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID,00:00:03.62
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM A DISTANT PLANET,00:00:04.63
A HALF A HEELOT,00:00:02.23
TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE,00:00:04.08
IN ORDER TO PINT THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS,00:00:04.46
THE COMPARISON TO OTHER WORKS ON DIFFERENT DATA BASIS IS STILL PROBLEMATIC,00:00:04.30
THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD,00:00:05.30
THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDEN HIS FRIEND WAS ENSBERCHEL INT OF HIS DESTINY,00:00:05.69
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT,00:00:03.26
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ,00:00:18.62
THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATE TREES AND INNUMERABLE COLOURED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM,00:00:09.14
GIVE ME THE RECEIVING ROOM,00:00:02.66
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK HOUD THE OLD WOMEN FOR THIS,00:00:04.44
BUT IN HIS OWN HE MILTED ID MATTEN,00:00:05.33
I WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT,00:00:02.21
THERE IS NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO TO NIGHT,00:00:03.05
THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY,00:00:02.62
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS,00:00:05.28
IT DIDN'T BRING WITH IT THE SMELL OF THE DESERT NOR THE THREAT OF MOORISH INVASION IT DIDN'T BRING WITH IT THE SMELL OF THE DESERT NOR THE THREAT OF MOORISH INVASION,00:00:28.46
HE LIVES AT THE ALFAUM OASIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID,00:00:06.14
AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS,00:00:06.48
THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANCHED THE SWORD NOW HELD A WHIP,00:00:05.02
THAT GUY OVER THERE LIKES TO DRINK A LOT TALK A LOT BUT DO NOTHING,00:00:05.06
ANOTHER HOUR TO RIDE IT,00:00:02.78
THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDAN SAID,00:00:03.50
HE APPROACHED THE MACE AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE IN THE SHAPE,00:00:04.22
I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OF HER PHONE,00:00:10.87
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOOT HIM,00:00:01.58
THE SPEECH WILL CONTINUE,00:00:03.41
ERCHEMY IS A SERIOUS DISCIPLINE,00:00:02.95
AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN,00:00:04.70
JUST WHAT IS THE LOW DOWN ON WILLIAMS,00:00:03.84
IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK,00:00:02.28
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO CALL ME,00:00:06.72
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH,00:00:03.38
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNAI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENT,00:00:07.87
I HAVE THE DIET OF A KED WHO FOUD TWENTY DOLLARS,00:00:03.86
THIS CAN AROUSE NATIONAL INTEREST,00:00:02.62
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT,00:00:05.59
BUT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT,00:00:02.57
THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION,00:00:03.89
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP,00:00:05.18
THE CRITUS AUTORITY ON MITIO RITES STATED THAT THE A OF ITS FIRST EPERANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES,00:00:07.78
ONCE TO THE THIEF AD WANTITY OF THE GENERAL,00:00:02.98
BECAUSE OF THE ALMONS THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.63
WELL WHY DID YOU SAY DOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LAUF DE SON ASKED DE BOY,00:00:04.94
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN,00:00:05.30
FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES,00:00:02.18
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF DANGER APPEARED,00:00:04.46
WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME TO SEE HIM,00:00:02.59
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF ANE SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER,00:00:06.41
THE CAT SAT ON THE FENCE,00:00:02.54
EVERYBODY QUIET AND READY FOR AN EMERGENCY,00:00:03.02
SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT WROTE IT ALL SAID THE SON,00:00:02.62
AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION,00:00:03.86
BUT BANKERS A MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SEPARATE,00:00:02.78
HAVE A GOOD TRICK,00:00:02.98
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:10.49
FATIMER WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TREASURE,00:00:03.38
I MAKE MY LIVING FORCASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID,00:00:04.58
I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID,00:00:02.62
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE,00:00:05.93
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE,00:00:07.34
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO JUST ANYONE,00:00:02.78
IT WAS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.46
TEN YEARS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL,00:00:06.02
THE WHOLE TOWN'S IN AN UPROAR,00:00:02.26
THE ENGLISHMEN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DINJA,00:00:03.89
THE REFERENCES ARE GOOD IN THE VERY NARROW AREA OF HISTOGRAM METHODS,00:00:04.25
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES,00:00:09.14
HERE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR,00:00:04.75
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALLIVE SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER,00:00:04.46
BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION,00:00:03.82
THE WHOLE CREATURE HEAVED AND PULSATED CONVULSIVELY,00:00:04.99
IF YOU KNOW YOUR HEART WELL IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO YOU,00:00:04.30
BUT THERE WAS A SIXTH DAY THE SUN WENT ON,00:00:03.86
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:04.37
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN,00:00:03.00
DUT STU POING DACK VIGE MOST PEOPLE TO GIVE UP,00:00:02.90
I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULPHUR,00:00:03.10
THIS IS A TRUT TO GIT YOUR SYMPATHY,00:00:02.86
JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU,00:00:03.38
BECAUSE OF THE OMENS THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:02.66
SOME DO COME BACK,00:00:02.09
WHAT DOES THAT GESSUS,00:00:02.26
THERE WAS A LOW OF HOSPITALITY,00:00:02.62
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:05.78
ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT,00:00:03.62
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT,00:00:05.06
NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAIT,00:00:04.22
AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS,00:00:03.19
AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION,00:00:02.66
HE LISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET,00:00:06.22
THERE THE ALCHEMISTS SEPARATED THE DISK INTO FOUR PARTS,00:00:05.02
I HADVE EVERY ONE HAS GARIBUSI'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN,00:00:04.18
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE ATOURNING,00:00:04.46
FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM UNDHER,00:00:02.54
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOW OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED,00:00:06.07
IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS,00:00:05.06
MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM,00:00:03.26
I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID,00:00:04.34
HE SAID THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN DESTINY,00:00:03.58
THENCE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEENT THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE,00:00:04.54
THAT'S GOOD THOUGHT THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:02.52
EVERYWHERE THERE WERE STALLS WITH ITEMS FOR SALE,00:00:04.34
GOING TO JULIUS,00:00:01.32
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUED ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVED EVERYDAY CONVERSATION,00:00:08.66
I THINK IT'S MARVELOUS,00:00:02.78
THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PECKED HIS BELONGINGS,00:00:04.42
BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND,00:00:06.98
THE LEAD HAD DRIED INTO THE SHAPE OF THE PAN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER LEAD,00:00:05.62
YOU MUST LOVE THE DESERT BUT NEVER TRUST IT ONTITI,00:00:05.26
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:06.38
ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT,00:00:05.59
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BOOK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND,00:00:07.18
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BETOL,00:00:04.18
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:05.14
NOW HIS INTRITION WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN COMING,00:00:03.86
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE HIR,00:00:06.10
EVENTUALLY THE MERCHANT HAD TO HIRE TUMOR EMPLORISE,00:00:03.86
LOOK AROUND SOMETIME,00:00:02.76
THE PEAK OF THIS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL,00:00:06.38
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD,00:00:04.44
THIS IS MY LOST CHANCE,00:00:02.42
WORRYINGLY THE REDIAL SIGNAL BECAME WEAKER,00:00:04.08
THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE,00:00:04.42
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED,00:00:02.59
THEIR DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON,00:00:05.59
NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS,00:00:04.82
GIVE ME MY BOOK THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.26
IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY ALTERNATIVE SEARCH ENGINES JUST GOUGGLE THEM,00:00:03.98
MAYBE DONALD WAS GOINE TO BE HER BEST MAN,00:00:04.18
HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR,00:00:06.22
DISOM THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE,00:00:04.78
HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDAGE AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS,00:00:04.63
THE DESERT TAKES OUR MEN FROM US AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RETURN SHE SAID,00:00:06.58
THE BOY WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID,00:00:04.22
THIS IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERON TABLET SAID THE ALCHEMIST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED,00:00:06.12
WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY,00:00:05.21
SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE,00:00:03.70
THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES,00:00:06.17
THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JOB HE SAID,00:00:05.02
THE LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED,00:00:03.02
GOOD BYE SAID THE BOY,00:00:05.74
THE CUTO STYLE COFFEE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,00:00:03.24
DON'T LET FACEBOOK TAKE UP ALL YOUR TIME,00:00:03.26
WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE INQREASE,00:00:03.43
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:04.78
THE CROWD ON THE FAR LEFT SEEMED TO GET BIGGER AND I HEARD NOW A FAINT MURMUR FROM IT,00:00:07.56
AND HIS FIFTY DOLLARS ON ACCOUNT,00:00:02.81
HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY,00:00:02.98
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO HELP,00:00:04.70
TURKEY FOR THANKSGIVING,00:00:02.69
I WISH IT WERE AS SIMPLE AS THAT,00:00:02.98
HE FONDLED HIS BRIGHT ORANGE BEARD,00:00:03.48
AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED,00:00:03.65
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:09.17
THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO BE ON THAT ROOF,00:00:02.90
SHE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEN WENT TO A SMALL CATHE NEAR BY,00:00:04.30
BUSINESS HAS REALLY IMPRUDE HE SAID TO THE BOY AFTER THE COSTUME  GOD LEFT,00:00:05.18
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR,00:00:03.46
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSA,00:00:05.98
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON,00:00:02.59
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT,00:00:03.72
WAT OUT FOR HIS VENOM THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.90
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:06.31
THERE IS NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT,00:00:05.38
I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS VENAMIMOUS BULK,00:00:04.10
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MAN'S MOUTH THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:05.66
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DOON,00:00:03.72
WE SPEAK OF THEM ONLY TO CHILDREN,00:00:02.23
THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE VAKER,00:00:06.53
I'M LEAVING TOWN TO NIGHT,00:00:03.02
THAT'S NO MY MONEY,00:00:09.31
THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED,00:00:04.56
WHAT AM I DOING,00:00:04.56
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED,00:00:04.73
THANK YOU SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.22
FOR AT THE TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW,00:00:05.74
I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DENDIN,00:00:14.78
FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK,00:00:08.02
HE FOLLOWED EVERY GAME AND HIS MOUTH'S WATERING,00:00:05.30
STARTING WITH HIS OWN,00:00:02.30
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE,00:00:01.54
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME,00:00:06.58
I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE OLCHYMIST SAID,00:00:04.37
ALL THE WORDS YOU'VE GOT,00:00:02.30
HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT,00:00:02.54
NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE,00:00:05.62
HE COULD SEE THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE,00:00:05.66
THEY ARE FORMING CLUBS,00:00:03.00
HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON,00:00:04.70
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKINGG ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE OTTAMA THE WIND SAID,00:00:05.38
THEY BEGIN CREEPING UP ON YOU TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING,00:00:03.34
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:05.21
THERE IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYBODY BUT ALREADY FORGOTTEN,00:00:06.48
WE MISS YOU AND MISS HAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU TOO CUT TO CATCH UP,00:00:07.85
WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED,00:00:03.24
HOW COME YOU SPHIX VANY SHE ASKED,00:00:04.18
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE AWAY BET WIN,00:00:08.62
LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS,00:00:02.47
THE MERCHANT TURNED TO A CUSTOMER WHO WANTED THREE CRYSTAL DRAGTES,00:00:04.30
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING,00:00:06.50
AT THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRET OF THE WORLD SHE SAID,00:00:03.65
STAND BY TO CONTACT AMANDA,00:00:02.14
FAT WOMAN STOLE MY PURSE,00:00:02.78
HE PUT HIS HEAD CLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMO'S SKIN,00:00:06.46
THE PLASTIC BARRIER SHATTERED,00:00:02.98
HER UP WINDON HAS BEEN CHANGED,00:00:02.06
MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SER RAY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT,00:00:04.61
YOU'RE LUCK'S NOT WITH YOU NOW,00:00:02.93
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PRESS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY URGED,00:00:04.70
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO MISTAKE,00:00:04.10
THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.84
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE REHURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF ROKING,00:00:05.30
IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED,00:00:03.29
I SHALL MAKE OF SOME ICE CUBES,00:00:03.38
BELYN CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR,00:00:06.53
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE,00:00:03.02
THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IS NOURISHED BY PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS,00:00:03.26
YOUR HEART IS ALIVE,00:00:02.54
THEIR PROPORTIONS WERE ALL WRONG,00:00:02.42
DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE,00:00:04.82
BUT I'M GOING IN SEARCH OF MY TREASURE THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.82
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED,00:00:05.18
THE ANGEL TOUCHED THA MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE,00:00:05.52
GIVE ME THAT CALL AN PATRICK'S WIRE,00:00:02.74
MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID,00:00:06.89
CHONISAM CRERPICUDE,00:00:04.78
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME,00:00:02.98
SHE PLACED THE GLASS CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE,00:00:04.25
HIS HANDS WERE ABRAIDED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART,00:00:05.02
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP,00:00:06.07
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO,00:00:06.60
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN BORN AN ARAB TO UNDERSTAND HE ANSWERED,00:00:05.02
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE,00:00:04.18
DON'T BE MORE CATHOLIC THAN THE POPE,00:00:03.17
I CAME TO TELL YOU JUST ONE THING THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.18
WHERE DID EVERYTHING GO,00:00:01.94
THOSE GIPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE FOUGHT,00:00:03.70
WHERE ARE YOU FROM THE BOY ASKED,00:00:03.24
THE ALCHYMIST PROBABLY ALREADY NEWELLED THAT,00:00:04.34
SOME STORMS ARE WORTH A WRECKAGE,00:00:04.42
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTIC AS FLUT,00:00:03.26
GOING UP TO SIEREN,00:00:02.45
YOU ARE PROBABLY WEAK FROM HUNGER,00:00:03.26
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP,00:00:04.46
MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE,00:00:04.63
THE TALE OF JAN MOVEMENT ISN'T THERE YET,00:00:04.13
AREN'T YOU ALLOWED TO KISS BACK,00:00:02.54
ON I SAW WATRAN ARMY SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.97
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS,00:00:05.18
MY PASSWORD HAS BEEN CHANGED WITHOUT PERMISSION,00:00:03.48
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER,00:00:05.38
AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER,00:00:03.43
IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIL,00:00:05.88
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO,00:00:03.50
I DON'T CARE IF SHE'VE BEEN AFTER IT FOR SIX YEARS,00:00:03.07
WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED,00:00:06.24
THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED,00:00:02.83
IN SPITE OF ZHIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE A MAN IN MALS,00:00:05.74
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND,00:00:03.67
REPLACE THE TEAS IN TIM TEBER'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSUMMENT GIV STALWOR'S CHARACTER,00:00:04.66
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME DESON US,00:00:04.10
THE WATCHMEN I MES THEY GROW DEMONSTRATING HOW THE WORLD IS ALWAYS CHANGING,00:00:05.76
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND,00:00:06.36
WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY,00:00:03.43
I CAN SEE APRIL COMING,00:00:02.06
WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB,00:00:02.90
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED,00:00:05.98
YOUR FACE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL,00:00:04.01
AND HE VANISHED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE PASA,00:00:02.71
THERE'S THE CITY HALL CARAM SUPPOSED TO VISIT,00:00:03.34
SOMETIME DURING A SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE,00:00:05.18
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED E ALGIS AND VIGERHORS,00:00:05.18
HOW DID IT STOT,00:00:01.70
BUT THEY DON'T COUNT,00:00:04.66
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE,00:00:03.60
YOU WEAK WHEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE JESIBEAU,00:00:03.14
I DARE HEAR TO MOVE THAT DESK OUT UF HERE,00:00:03.19
BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE,00:00:02.64
AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE HAND LIVED,00:00:06.82
THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHIMISTS,00:00:05.26
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE ABSOLUTELY DESFIGABLE THAT JIGA RED MEN OF FALLHOOEDIN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:22.94
I AM GOING TO THEM,00:00:03.00
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW,00:00:05.33
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.82
I MYSELF HEAR OF NOTHING OF THAT,00:00:02.38
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD,00:00:06.38
I USED TO LIVE NEAR EL CIRUM HE SAID,00:00:05.38
HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CEMELSKIN,00:00:04.90
HEDS POPPING DECK BEHIND DOOR,00:00:02.54
IS CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY,00:00:03.65
HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE,00:00:03.98
AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS,00:00:03.74
CAN I GET A WHAT WHAT,00:00:03.86
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:05.06
EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BELIEVE OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WAR,00:00:05.86
THE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:02.64
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE,00:00:03.70
THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RITTERN FROM EGYPT HE WOULD BUY THAT SWORD,00:00:05.86
THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT INTENSELY RELIEVED,00:00:06.67
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG,00:00:01.70
NO WONDER YOU JUMPED IN THE RIVER,00:00:03.82
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG,00:00:02.42
THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FAIND THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:04.46
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS,00:00:05.71
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER,00:00:04.78
WHEN YOU ARE IN LAW THINGS MAKE EVEN WAR SENDS HE THOUGHT,00:00:04.82
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE ELDERS,00:00:03.14
NOT UNLESS WE'RE BLIND,00:00:02.59
THIS IS FOR YOU,00:00:05.86
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HER,00:00:04.97
HE SEEMED UNFRIENDLY AND HAD LOOKED IRRITATED WHEN THE BOY HAD ENTERED,00:00:04.82
THERE ARE RUMOURS OF TRIVAL WARS HE TOLD THEM,00:00:02.90
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:05.26
BEFORE GAS WERE INVENTED OURMILS HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO FIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WARD,00:00:11.78
MANY TELESCOPES WERE APPOINTED AT IT,00:00:03.02
LETS STOP THIS ANOTHER COMMANDER SAID,00:00:03.65
THE HORSE REERED AGAIN RISING A CLOUD OF DUST,00:00:05.30
THEY'RE NOT MY SHAPE ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT ASTALGA,00:00:05.21
IT'S LIKE THE CAMER DRIPPER SAID EAT WINS TIME TO HAT,00:00:04.78
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS,00:00:03.36
MAYBE WE CAN WATON IT AT WIT EFOTATING THE TITLES AND THE TEXT EVERYWHEREIL,00:00:06.58
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEAR BY MIL CHERRY CAMP,00:00:04.78
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE,00:00:02.78
TAKE THESE KEPSUDES OVER TO MISSUS DAVID'S HOUSE,00:00:02.74
IF WE SERVED T IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPEND,00:00:05.64
AND HE HADN'T PERCEIVED THEM BECAUSE HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THEM,00:00:07.80
A LOTCH PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OF AND FAILED WITH A LOUT AND SHARP VOICE,00:00:05.18
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS THING,00:00:04.37
I'M GOING TO THEM,00:00:01.61
THEIR HORSES CRIED OUT AND ALL THEIR WEAPONS WERE FILLED WITH SAND,00:00:06.58
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH,00:00:03.70
TO NOURICHE DE FALCON,00:00:03.26
ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO,00:00:05.90
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANT TO TELL ME,00:00:03.62
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION,00:00:06.58
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH ME,00:00:02.06
I AM DEFTLY OPEN TO THE IDEA BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER,00:00:05.76
MY KEACHING IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET,00:00:06.41
AT HIS SIDE WAS A YOUNG HARABSY BOY HAD SPOKEN WITH HERLIER,00:00:05.30
AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION,00:00:06.10
THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN,00:00:02.62
BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND,00:00:04.66
I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALPEMISTS ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMAN,00:00:05.90
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:02.62
THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO,00:00:03.46
WATCH OUT FOR HIS VENOM THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.14
DO YOU CARE IF I SEE DOWN OUT HERE,00:00:03.02
WE WERE ALL MADE BY THE SAME HAND AND WE HAVE THE SAME SOUL,00:00:04.70
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEAR BY MILITARY CAMP,00:00:04.78
CAN'T THEY SEE IT'S A FRAME UP,00:00:02.88
THE BOY TOOK OUT URIM AND THUMBHIM FROM HIS BACK,00:00:05.93
AH THE WHOLE POLICE FORCE STANDING ON ITS EAR,00:00:04.66
MUST HAVE BEEN THAT JUMP IN THE COLD WATER,00:00:03.46
THERE DOST O ILOF STONS,00:00:04.34
WAIT TILL THOSE TWO FUTURE JAILBERIES READ THE MORNING POST TO MORROW,00:00:06.14
HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER,00:00:01.75
I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,00:00:03.70
DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE,00:00:05.18
I THOUGHT THE ENSCRURING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:03.86
HE PUT IT IN HIS BACK POCKET,00:00:03.46
IN GENERAL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTIES ESTIMATING RISKS CORRECTLY,00:00:04.61
NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT,00:00:06.53
HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED,00:00:02.54
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT TWO MINUTES,00:00:05.35
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET,00:00:03.26
THE BOY NOTICED THE THE ONER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION,00:00:04.49
YOU OLD SORCERER THE BOY SHOUTED UP TO THE SKY,00:00:03.74
BUT MY HEART IS ANGETITEN THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.79
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT,00:00:04.46
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T ULE YOUR COLUMN ANY MORE,00:00:05.66
I THINK IT'S PLENTY TERRIFIC,00:00:02.66
I'VE SUDDENLY BECOME QUITE IMPORTANT,00:00:02.78
HE TOOK BACK HIS BOOKS AND PACKED THEM AWAY AGAIN IN THEIR BAGS,00:00:07.42
THE ALCHEMIST OPENED A BOTTLE AND POURED A RED LIQUID INTO THE BOY'S CUP,00:00:05.26
YOU FORGOT TO PACK IT,00:00:02.06
THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERY ONE STOOD,00:00:06.62
BUT MY HEART IS AGITATED THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.38
D UREGE,00:00:01.97
THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOLP,00:00:03.62
THAT'S NOT MY MONEY,00:00:02.90
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT THE OMENS,00:00:03.62
ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRESCEND TIME AND DISTACE,00:00:05.30
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:06.46
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:02.69
WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT,00:00:06.10
HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PURAFITS WERE,00:00:06.05
THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WINE WAS REPRESSING,00:00:03.94
MOST OF THEM WERE STIRRING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE,00:00:03.50
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND WIFE WENTEL,00:00:03.94
ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION,00:00:03.89
HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE,00:00:05.90
BUT AM GOING IN MY SERGE OF MY TREASURE THE BOYS SAID,00:00:04.46
THE SIMMON BLUE THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN BEFORE,00:00:04.37
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF DANGER APPEARED,00:00:05.04
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING YOU'VE GOTTE GO GET IT,00:00:02.74
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:06.96
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT,00:00:04.73
THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING,00:00:02.38
THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN,00:00:02.50
WRAPPED IN A SCALF AND BLINDED BY THE BLIZZARD THE BOY SCRAMBLED FOR THE SUBWAY,00:00:05.76
AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS,00:00:07.70
I'M GETTING TREMPER READY,00:00:01.94
THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,00:00:02.95
I SHALL MAKE SOME ICE CUBES,00:00:03.46
I BURNED THE OMELET,00:00:05.16
A BRIEZE BEGAN TO BLOW,00:00:02.50
I'D KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE,00:00:02.54
THE TWO MEN EXTANSOM WAS IN ARABIC AND THE BAROWNER SEEMED IRRITATED,00:00:05.06
THE AREA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO INTENSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM VIEW,00:00:06.62
EVERYONE HAS HIS OR HER OWN WAY OF LEARNING THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.91
I COULDN'T STOP STARING AT IT,00:00:04.06
AS THEY SAT DOWN AT THE ONLY TABLE IN THE PLACE THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT LAUGHED,00:00:04.34
THE INGENIOUS PHYSICIST WRAPPED HIS NOSE AND SCRATCHED HIS CHIN,00:00:05.35
IT WAS DROPPING UP IN FLAKES AND READING DOWN IN THE SAND,00:00:03.77
AND THE MURMURER LASTED LONGER THAN A SIBLE VOW WOULD HAVE,00:00:04.75
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WAKING,00:00:05.06
BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE THE GREENFIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME,00:00:05.35
IT WAS AS IF IT QUAVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING,00:00:06.82
AFTER ALL O DOSN'T WANT TO WORCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND AT YV GREAT HEIGHTS,00:00:04.78
I LEARNED THE ALCHEMIST SECRETS IN MY TRAVELS,00:00:03.12
I HAD THE EVERY ONE HAS GARYBUTY'S TEETH TO DREAM AGAIN,00:00:05.30
I GUESS I WAS HOMESICK,00:00:01.94
IT SEEMED IUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILT,00:00:05.09
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE,00:00:05.45
HE APROASHED  THE MASS AND WOOD SURPRISED AT SIZE AND THE SHAY PUT,00:00:10.44
THEY ALL COMPLAIN THEY'RE PRACTICALLY WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT,00:00:03.72
IF ONLY WE COULD SEE IT,00:00:02.74
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT,00:00:04.68
I POINTED OUT ANCE A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT,00:00:02.86
WHAT ARE THEY DOING THE OLD MAN ASKED POINTING AT THE PEOPLE IN THE PLAZA,00:00:04.20
THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS BOY WHO SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD,00:00:09.84
IT'S LIKE THE KEMEL DRIVER'S HEAD EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT,00:00:05.38
THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT I DESERVE A PART OF WHAT YOU FIND,00:00:04.46
AND HE WASN'T VERY MUCH BETTER,00:00:04.37
HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND,00:00:03.86
AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY,00:00:05.26
I AM LOOKING FOR TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT,00:00:06.58
THEY HAVE CHEAP SAUSAGES AND FRIES OF THE BREWERY TO MORROW,00:00:04.42
I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK,00:00:03.14
I DONT CLAM IM,00:00:03.50
WELL THEN HAPPY DO THAT THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.48
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,00:00:02.62
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER,00:00:06.10
THE BOY TOOK OU AREMAN THUMBHIM FROM HIS BAG,00:00:04.34
THE CUSHION WAS SOFT AND INVITING,00:00:02.40
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN,00:00:02.42
THEY FORGOT THAT LEI COWPER AND INE HAD THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFIL,00:00:05.93
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME EITHER HAD TOUCHED THE OTHER,00:00:02.74
IT WASN'T MUCH ANYWAY,00:00:02.90
THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:04.13
UNLIKE VOICE CODE WHICH IS A COMPLETE SOLUTION DRAGON FLY IS JUST AN IMPROVED PIPE ON A P I TO DRAGON,00:00:06.60
SOME PLACE TECOUD E PUT IN,00:00:03.38
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID,00:00:04.90
DON'T MIND THE COLONEL,00:00:02.78
ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED,00:00:03.70
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WON'T BE FIXED UNTIL A CONSUMA VISION WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A RELEASE DAT YET,00:00:06.55
AND LONE AN EVERY GRAVE WIS IN THIS NOBLE BLIFE,00:00:02.66
ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED BERIAL CEREMONY,00:00:04.58
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNISE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED,00:00:06.74
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELLED WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:05.02
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY,00:00:01.97
WE ARE OBLIGED AT LEAST ONCE IN OUR LIVES TO VISIT THE HOLY CITY OF MEICA,00:00:04.97
THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT,00:00:08.69
NO THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:02.54
THE BOY WAS STARTLED,00:00:01.97
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIS'S TENT WITH THE HORSE,00:00:04.78
HE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS REGARDING ME,00:00:04.25
I'M BEGINNING TO REALISE THAT,00:00:02.90
IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING,00:00:06.29
IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT WAS MEAN,00:00:03.86
VICKIE WANTED TO NOT MAKE A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF,00:00:04.06
HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND,00:00:03.72
BUT I FELT MISERABLE WATCHING HIM WITHER AWAY LIKE A SHRIVELLED DANDELIAN,00:00:06.22
YOU ALREADY KNOW ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW,00:00:02.42
YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT,00:00:02.62
SHE AND THE JUDGE ARE LIKE CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE,00:00:03.10
WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY,00:00:05.42
HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DURING HIS FIRST BLESSON AN DRIVING SCHOOL,00:00:05.38
I'M GOING TO NEED IT,00:00:02.98
THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ,00:00:03.41
THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC,00:00:02.09
MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS,00:00:05.50
ON RAINY DAYS I WILL PLAY INSIDE,00:00:03.26
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR,00:00:03.74
THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION,00:00:03.58
THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY A GLASSES,00:00:04.58
THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE,00:00:04.10
I'LL TOUCH YOU TO NIGHT,00:00:02.30
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALAMNI OR RESPECTIVE STUDENTS,00:00:05.83
ANOTHER RUN ON THE BANK,00:00:02.14
THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED,00:00:07.30
TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT,00:00:02.98
WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED,00:00:04.10
MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE,00:00:03.22
AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO,00:00:04.68
STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES,00:00:02.74
DON'T BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.46
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL A WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN,00:00:05.04
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE,00:00:07.32
HER OLD MAN WAS DOC MITCHELL,00:00:02.78
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME THERE IF YOU CAN,00:00:03.94
THE EOASUS IS NEUTRAL GROUND,00:00:03.86
HE PREPERRED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS,00:00:04.54
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US,00:00:04.18
IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT MONEY CAN SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE,00:00:03.46
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT,00:00:05.52
IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS,00:00:25.34
TO STUFF INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS,00:00:02.62
I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU,00:00:01.90
CAN I GET A HOOP BOT,00:00:04.68
I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:03.38
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED,00:00:03.98
AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER,00:00:05.38
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL,00:00:03.82
THE RECTANGLE WAS PARALLEL TO THE SQUARE,00:00:04.63
I FEEL SO GOOD I COULD SPIT,00:00:01.73
COVER UP THAT TRANSMITTER,00:00:02.62
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM,00:00:02.54
THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE,00:00:03.00
HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU,00:00:01.90
ELLY WON FIRST PRIZE IN THE SPELLING COMPETITION,00:00:04.87
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS,00:00:06.82
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:05.16
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATE,00:00:02.06
WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPATINO,00:00:02.74
HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHER,00:00:02.35
MANY TELESCOPES WERE APPINED AT AT IT,00:00:03.98
NO DOUBT THE IMPECT HAD COLED THE FLESH OF FIRE,00:00:04.03
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID,00:00:06.58
THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS AGILERY AND HENDERSHAN HAD LEFT IT,00:00:05.16
THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS,00:00:06.29
HE WAS DRESSED ONLY IN HIS PAJAMAS,00:00:03.84
WHAT TIME IS IT,00:00:02.26
THE HORSEMAN WAS COMPLETELY IMMOBLE AS WAS TABLE,00:00:05.28
AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE PASSING MY SHOP ALL THE TIME HEADING FOR MACA AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE PASSING MY SHOP ALL THE TIME HEADING FOR MACA WHO STOP,00:00:16.39
YOU CAN ONLY SPLIT OUT SO MANY SEEDS,00:00:02.26
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOWED AND SHARP NOISE,00:00:06.26
TOUFFY QOATED ON THE SURFACES IT WAS DISGUSTINGLY STICKY,00:00:06.98
SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK,00:00:06.22
AND THE FOLK AN THER NOURISHET MAN,00:00:04.70
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN,00:00:04.90
DID YOU SEE THIS PICTURE ON THE COVER OF TIME,00:00:02.93
IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHYMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE,00:00:05.38
THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP,00:00:03.38
E HOPE IT WORKS,00:00:01.46
THEY STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE MOON,00:00:02.42
THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR,00:00:06.02
IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT,00:00:05.11
THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SUITE SICKLY SMELLERBLED,00:00:06.84
I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.94
THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE ERNIMATAL,00:00:04.73
NOW HE WAS HERE NOT WITH HIS FLOCK BUT WITH A SHOVEL,00:00:04.25
HE HOPED THAT HE WOULD BE SOME ONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE,00:00:04.90
THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER,00:00:05.90
I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,00:00:02.78
THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS,00:00:05.54
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME,00:00:07.08
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND,00:00:04.66
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW,00:00:03.98
DOS SHE HAVE THE MONEY,00:00:01.58
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBUGGER HELPER,00:00:04.82
WE NEED TO RUN,00:00:02.90
HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER,00:00:02.90
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD,00:00:06.14
YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID,00:00:03.38
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SO PROFOUND THAT IT SEEMED THE CITY WAS ASLEEP,00:00:05.88
I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE,00:00:02.28
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE,00:00:03.72
YOU CAN TRY USING AN ICERACKER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT THE PRECISION ISN'T QUITE HIGH ENOUGH,00:00:04.92
YOU HAVE ENOUGH GO TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS,00:00:05.74
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:06.29
HIS NAME IS WELSH,00:00:01.87
ENOUGH SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.46
HE IS TRYING TO DRINK YOU AGAIN,00:00:02.90
I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME,00:00:05.18
THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY,00:00:03.96
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY,00:00:03.94
ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT,00:00:02.62
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW,00:00:04.46
FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD,00:00:04.99
WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY,00:00:06.00
IT LOOKED LIKE A RASTY GAS FLOAT,00:00:02.52
WHAT HE UPIL,00:00:02.74
THESE ARE THE SPIES SAID ONE OF THE MEN,00:00:03.65
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR,00:00:05.06
AS FAST AS I CAN,00:00:02.30
YOUR OFFICE TELEPHONED ME TO HOLD HIM,00:00:02.62
HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOLL AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEAR BY,00:00:04.18
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AN OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE,00:00:06.10
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLING APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:06.38
THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING,00:00:03.38
EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY,00:00:03.02
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:04.44
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:03.89
THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED,00:00:03.60
AND ABOUT YOU TOO,00:00:02.66
IT WAS STAR LIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE JORDIA TO HER,00:00:07.25
AMERICANS LOVE TO HAVE A BARBICUE,00:00:03.82
TARKEE FULL OF THANKSGIVING,00:00:02.74
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY,00:00:04.25
FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS,00:00:03.26
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY,00:00:07.30
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED,00:00:02.26
IT WAS FAINLY MARKED WITH TRANSFERRED STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT REALM,00:00:06.31
MISTER NALLSON COME YET,00:00:02.18
AND THEN THEY WANTED THE PERSON TO CHANGE,00:00:03.98
THEY ARE BON PRIVATE AND POPIC,00:00:03.38
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED,00:00:03.94
NIWA SAVED THEM FOR SWEED,00:00:03.26
NOTE THAT THE EMEC' EXTENSION AS JUNK MODE WORKED SIMILARLY TO THIS,00:00:06.98
WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT,00:00:02.90
NEVER STOP CREAMING THE OLD KING HAD SAID,00:00:03.58
THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.82
HE APPEARED WITH THE FIRST STARS OF EVENING,00:00:06.34
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:03.67
I THOUGHT HOLD BUY THEM SOME GROCERIES,00:00:02.02
IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING,00:00:10.32
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE FOUR GINGER BRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:07.44
AND HE VANISHED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA,00:00:04.46
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:05.40
MOST METEO RITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:04.44
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING EGH,00:00:09.12
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK INTO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP,00:00:05.26
IF YOU START YOUR FEMALES WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH,00:00:06.38
WHY DO THEY NEED JIN,00:00:02.86
I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWNCASTLE BEHIND,00:00:05.02
BEFORE THE SUN HAD REACHED ITS HIGH POINT FIVE HUNDRED TRIBESMEN APPEARED ON THE HORIZON,00:00:10.75
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON MITERITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES,00:00:11.30
IT IS I WHO DARE TO DO SO SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.29
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN,00:00:03.26
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FOLLEN MARES BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:05.09
TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON THEY CAME UP UPON ACOPTIC MONASQERY,00:00:06.19
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE,00:00:02.50
TAKING THE FAIRY  WISAWISE CHOICE,00:00:02.50
THEYARE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED,00:00:03.22
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE,00:00:02.54
FOR TIMMER APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT,00:00:02.90
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT,00:00:04.66
SOMEWHERE YOU ARE HOLDING THE PERSON I LOVE THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.46
THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY,00:00:06.98
SHE TOOK CARE OF BOBBY FOR US,00:00:03.38
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING HE SAID AS HE LET THE BOY OUTSIDE,00:00:04.90
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:07.75
THE BOY THANKED HIM ATE IT AND WENT UP HIS WAY,00:00:04.22
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE,00:00:13.32
THEY REPRISENT MILLIONS OF VOTERS,00:00:04.51
HAVE LIVE CALLED ME IN THE RESTAURANT IN TWENTY MINUTES,00:00:03.89
PUT DOWN THAT CHAIR,00:00:03.00
ONLY WHEN HE CONSENTS,00:00:02.66
SHE FELT LIKE A WEAKLING IN COMPARISON TO HER NEWBORN DAUGHTER,00:00:04.10
CASHMAN WALKED ALONGBESIDE THE CANOL,00:00:04.44
ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED,00:00:04.10
WHO'S THE TEN FOR,00:00:02.47
I CAN'T THINK ANY MORE,00:00:03.19
MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:03.24
BUT BEFORE I GO I WON'T GET DOWN ON IN STILY,00:00:03.46
AND YOU TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:04.70
THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING,00:00:04.49
LANA JOINED BY CHARLES TO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER SUBLIME SINKING VOICE,00:00:06.82
WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED HE ASKED THE ENGLISHMAN ONE NIGHT,00:00:06.24
DON'T YO KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON,00:00:03.34
WHY DON'T WE SEARCH THEIR ROOMS,00:00:02.64
THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY,00:00:05.66
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILLY,00:00:06.77
HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HA SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID,00:00:05.42
HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY MARRIED,00:00:04.22
BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID,00:00:03.77
EXPERIMENTS ARE UNCONVENCING,00:00:02.98
IT PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND I WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEBOR,00:00:05.54
IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT,00:00:02.54
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:05.42
WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID,00:00:04.22
IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN,00:00:07.46
I'LL TAKE MY NOW,00:00:02.11
THE CONCRETE WAS COVERED IN MOSS,00:00:02.74
IT'S THE MASTER WORK IN THE ALCHINISTS,00:00:03.43
MASIZED ATTEMPTING IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WOG,00:00:08.90
I'LL SEE YOU GET IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES,00:00:03.43
WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT,00:00:04.34
YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.82
BUT THERE'S A TRIBE OF WAR THE BOY REITERATED,00:00:03.46
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT,00:00:03.77
IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE,00:00:04.06
BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHIMIST SAID TO THE MONK,00:00:05.06
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T,00:00:02.14
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY SAIT,00:00:05.45
AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE,00:00:05.54
YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET,00:00:02.30
ON THE SECOND DAY THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A CLIFF NEAR THE CAMP,00:00:06.50
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SAVE ME,00:00:03.14
GIVE ME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,00:00:03.98
BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE,00:00:04.46
BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT A MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY,00:00:05.54
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,00:00:05.02
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY,00:00:04.22
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURG ER HELPER,00:00:04.78
THIS IS WHY ALCHEMY EXISTS THE BOY SAID,00:00:02.98
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID DE WOMAN,00:00:02.78
WE MUST STAY HIDDEN,00:00:02.06
UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN,00:00:05.11
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE,00:00:02.42
AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME,00:00:09.10
THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS,00:00:04.61
BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE,00:00:10.18
THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT,00:00:04.15
EVERY PURCHASE IS A VOTE,00:00:03.00
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR,00:00:04.49
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED,00:00:05.50
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE,00:00:10.08
HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WARD,00:00:06.86
THEY HAD DONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE,00:00:04.22
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:03.94
HE'S ON THE WAY,00:00:01.87
WATER BOARDING IS A TERRIBLE FORM OF TORTURE,00:00:03.38
I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE,00:00:04.63
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:04.70
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW,00:00:05.04
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE,00:00:02.21
BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING,00:00:02.62
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECOND,00:00:02.98
HAVEN'T YOU EVEN STARTED,00:00:01.37
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING ALLSET,00:00:02.83
PLEASE DAN'T MET ME,00:00:02.30
I'M GETTING TRIVER READY,00:00:02.66
AND THIS WAS NOT A BUSINESS MAN,00:00:02.23
HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD,00:00:03.50
I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK,00:00:02.26
AS THEY CAME IT 'S DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING,00:00:04.25
THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT,00:00:04.10
WHATILL IT TAKE TILL THE BANK REOPENS,00:00:02.88
HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCK,00:00:06.55
THAT'S TOO FAR FROM THE BEDROOM,00:00:03.26
EMPTHY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TINT,00:00:03.67
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATE,00:00:02.54
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID THE KASAN,00:00:06.38
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAY,00:00:04.20
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT,00:00:04.46
I FEEL QUITE AMBIVOLENT ABOUT THE ARTICLE,00:00:04.25
FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM AND THEIR OWN,00:00:02.95
THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK,00:00:05.69
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND,00:00:03.48
THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANKS,00:00:03.48
THIS IS THE MAYOR,00:00:02.11
IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING,00:00:07.18
YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME THE LAST TIME,00:00:03.14
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPUTER,00:00:05.11
EVERYTHING'S GETTING COLD AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,00:00:05.18
WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY,00:00:05.14
THE LENDS WAS HEAVY BUT HAD AN AMAZING ZOO,00:00:03.22
I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS,00:00:02.54
THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE,00:00:04.54
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND SHAPE,00:00:04.78
BITTER BRING A GLOSS OF MILK,00:00:02.04
WE SHOVLLED OP AND GAVE THREE MINUTES HPEECHES EACH,00:00:04.10
THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY,00:00:07.58
IT'S SATURDAY IT'S HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO DRY THE DRY RAMIN,00:00:04.94
AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOF IS SOON AN ELEPHANT IN THE HOUSE,00:00:04.34
WHY THE SHOTS STOP AFTER THE TENT NO ONE OONERT HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:08.64
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT,00:00:03.60
HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO DO FIRST,00:00:02.78
HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEAR BY,00:00:04.20
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINION SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING,00:00:06.22
OHEDTHA EVERYONE HAS GARRY BUSY'S TEETH TRY BEGIN,00:00:05.66
AS FOSTER AS I CAN,00:00:02.18
NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD,00:00:06.74
IT MAY BE THE GUESSES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS IN CONVENIENCE,00:00:04.99
THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO ROLL AS GOLD HAD,00:00:05.54
WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY,00:00:03.89
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUEY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS,00:00:05.04
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:05.81
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON STRIMMING BEFORE MY EYES,00:00:09.02
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECK POINT,00:00:06.84
I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT,00:00:02.74
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED,00:00:04.92
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL,00:00:05.02
THE HERDER WAS ON FIRE AND YO COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY,00:00:05.06
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE,00:00:07.66
THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS,00:00:08.38
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT,00:00:09.02
HUMMING DOWN THE BLOCK IS THE BIGGEST STEAM ROLLER I HAVE EVER SEEN,00:00:06.70
BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED,00:00:04.34
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY,00:00:04.32
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS IMBEDDED IN THE GROUND,00:00:08.21
AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND,00:00:06.98
I AM GOING TO BUILD A BRIDGE A MILE LONG,00:00:03.46
INPETA STILL TO BE ALONE WITH ONE'S BOOK,00:00:07.22
HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM,00:00:03.19
IT'S CRAWLING WITH COPS OUTSIDE,00:00:03.74
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING,00:00:05.06
SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE,00:00:03.00
I REMEMBER GRAN'PA PAW LOOKING THROUGH IT,00:00:03.02
GET MARTIN OUT OF JAIL,00:00:03.62
I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BE ABLE TO PINE LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:07.06
AND IAM SORRY TO SAY THAT THE CONGESTION IS INCREASING,00:00:04.08
WELL THEN WE GOT A BOL,00:00:03.26
WE DON'T WANT HIM,00:00:01.99
MAKES ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR,00:00:03.22
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT,00:00:05.90
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED,00:00:03.19
DON'T SAY ANYTHING FATIMA INTERRUPTED,00:00:03.43
TEN YEARS AT UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL,00:00:05.62
I AM A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE,00:00:04.54
I COULDN'T STOP STARING AT IT,00:00:04.46
I ADMIT THAT I AM AN ARCOHOLIC,00:00:02.98
DEY LOOKET FOR THE FILIN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:09.65
DAT FIRST DEY EVERYONE SLEPPED FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING ENGLISHMAN,00:00:09.55
HE GLISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET,00:00:05.83
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FOLLL MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:04.34
UNTIL THEN HE CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD,00:00:05.57
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,00:00:02.78
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN,00:00:05.62
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RHYME,00:00:02.47
HISTORY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE ETIS,00:00:06.38
I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS,00:00:13.18
YOU CAN VERIFY AND REALECORD YOUR OWN RECORDINGS BEFORE SUBMITTING THEM,00:00:05.14
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY,00:00:04.46
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE,00:00:04.82
WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE USED TO IT,00:00:02.98
DEATH MAKE SENSE THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED,00:00:07.42
I WISH YOU EVERY POSSIBLE HAPPINESS AND JOY,00:00:07.51
RAS WELL TO NIGHT AS IF YOU HAD A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR GONWET,00:00:03.38
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK,00:00:05.86
WE WERE ALL MADE BY THE SAME HAND AND WE HAVE THE SAME SOUL,00:00:05.71
ALL TANES ARE ONE THE OLD MEN HAD SAID,00:00:04.22
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT LOVE NEVER KEEPS A MAN FROM PURSUING HIS DESTINY,00:00:06.22
I TURNED AND AS I DID SO THE SCREW MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT,00:00:04.44
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN,00:00:02.40
I'M GOING TO THEM,00:00:02.26
I WENT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHIPES THE JUNES,00:00:05.16
THAT SHE WANTED TO TRAVELS,00:00:02.66
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY FATHER,00:00:03.70
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BOLDING IN LONE,00:00:02.90
HENDESON STOOD UP WITH THE SPADE IN HIS HAND,00:00:04.18
BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT,00:00:04.82
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY,00:00:01.58
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE,00:00:03.48
IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER,00:00:06.14
GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE PHONE,00:00:01.94
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM,00:00:04.63
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY,00:00:04.20
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS,00:00:02.47
SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY TO ME,00:00:02.83
SHE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON,00:00:03.10
CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE,00:00:03.26
HOW DO YOU DO,00:00:01.58
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT,00:00:03.38
THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID,00:00:06.34
I FORGOT YOU WERE HERE,00:00:02.54
WHAT'S YO DOING OVER HERE,00:00:01.70
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE,00:00:02.06
THAT SUBBERED HIM A LITTLE,00:00:02.02
WHAT DID YOU WISH WHEN YOU THROGH THAT ROCK,00:00:03.74
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOLISEID WITH A START,00:00:04.22
HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR,00:00:05.62
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD,00:00:04.39
WATCH OVER HER TO NIGHT,00:00:02.81
YOUR MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OVER HALF THE NIGHT,00:00:03.10
THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER,00:00:03.38
HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HOCKS OVER HIS SHOULDER,00:00:02.86
HANGES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL HIM,00:00:02.86
WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHIP THAN FROM BOOKS THE ANSWEREF,00:00:05.14
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE,00:00:02.54
HAPPEN TO HAVE EIGHT THOUSAND BUCKS ON YOU,00:00:03.02
MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD,00:00:05.42
WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WALL,00:00:01.94
WELL THEN WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM,00:00:04.54
I'M A SOCCO FOR,00:00:01.30
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SERIOUS,00:00:02.45
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON,00:00:06.05
I'VE BEEN LAUGHING ALL DAY ABOUT THAT,00:00:02.35
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SAILER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WOCKAWAY,00:00:08.02
DOUN THE CHAIR,00:00:02.38
AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE,00:00:05.86
THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE,00:00:06.12
THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF DE JOB HE SAID,00:00:03.79
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPT AN ZS TO LONDON,00:00:04.66
BUT THE ENGLISHMEN WERE EXULTAT,00:00:03.55
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PAYSPORT FIRST,00:00:07.58
SOME WENT AWAY WHY I WAS THERE AN OTHEH PEOPLE KAN,00:00:04.61
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY,00:00:02.16
THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE,00:00:01.73
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,00:00:02.62
SOME DO COME BACK,00:00:03.34
LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL,00:00:03.98
AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS TE FAIR PRICE POR EVERY ONE OT PES ANNIMELS,00:00:10.70
SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS,00:00:04.22
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK,00:00:07.06
MARILIE OF THE SUN ONE STAR,00:00:03.31
MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE,00:00:04.34
SABRO MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIDDLE WHISPERE NAMED NEVAHACA,00:00:05.66
MY BOY POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELOW SINAL LIGHTS,00:00:07.75
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE CAN'T GET AWAY,00:00:03.00
MAWIT WILL WEAVE IT FORT,00:00:02.42
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGEBRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN THE HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:08.35
AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO FIND THE HIDDEN TREASURE,00:00:03.02
AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED,00:00:07.06
DUSK WAS FALLING AT THE BOYARIE WITH HIS HARD HAT AN ABANDONED JUDGE,00:00:05.76
I'LL TELL YOU IN EM A MINUTE,00:00:03.74
I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLIS,00:00:04.94
THE ELEVATOR'S CAR STILL RUNNING,00:00:02.74
THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED UNTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER,00:00:06.26
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE,00:00:01.82
BUT THERE WAS A SIXTH DAY THE SUN WENT ON,00:00:04.63
AREN'T WE GODLIKE,00:00:02.42
WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA,00:00:05.64
AT NIGHT THEY SPREAD THEIR SLEEPING YEAR END KEPT THEIR FIRES HIDDEN,00:00:05.66
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANT CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING,00:00:06.38
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHYMIST THE WIND SAID,00:00:06.02
I HAPPENED TO KNOW CONVAY WAS MARRIED ONLY THREE MONTHS AGO,00:00:06.19
HE BROUGHT HIS HEART INDO HIS MOUTH,00:00:02.38
BUT SHE'LL BE THERE,00:00:02.04
AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART,00:00:04.70
YE'LL MARRY FLATI MAH AND YE'LL WOT BE HAPPY FOR A YEAR,00:00:06.82
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:06.02
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE,00:00:02.54
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES,00:00:03.26
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WALKING,00:00:03.82
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES,00:00:03.60
I'LL COVER THE METHOD I USE AND DESCRIBE SOME ALTERNATIVES,00:00:03.72
AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHYMIST SAID,00:00:04.94
ZAHUKAS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GODS STOOD AT ATTENTION,00:00:04.82
ANUSUAL HAVE BEEN MADE BY HE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE,00:00:04.68
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB,00:00:02.54
ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARDS HIS DESTINY,00:00:04.22
THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH,00:00:04.10
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT,00:00:05.42
YOU CAN'T SEE THE PLANET WITH THE NAKED EYE,00:00:03.58
HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.94
SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ENTIRELY TRUE,00:00:07.08
DON THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR,00:00:03.02
I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU,00:00:12.17
MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT,00:00:04.97
THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM,00:00:05.62
THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS,00:00:04.70
COME INTO THE OFFICE A MINUTE,00:00:02.78
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE,00:00:02.38
FRANK WAS GNIGHING SO THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAVE HIM,00:00:04.46
YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID,00:00:04.70
THERE IS ONE THAT SAYS EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN,00:00:04.22
MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BEGTI OF I,00:00:03.82
LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE,00:00:06.50
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS COMMUTE FROM THE SURROUNDINGS INTO THE CITY EACH DAY,00:00:04.56
THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,00:00:02.83
BUT THEY WERE NOT DERE,00:00:01.56
SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES,00:00:04.42
IS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO SPURIOUS AWAKENINGS THAN THE SLEEP MODE,00:00:05.66
THAT'S THE REASON WHY I CAME IN FORTH,00:00:07.01
WHENCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE IS NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER,00:00:06.94
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:04.30
I HAVE A DIET OF A KIFT WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS,00:00:04.51
THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE,00:00:02.66
HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD,00:00:03.65
AND WE HAD A BITE,00:00:01.94
NOT EVEN A STEAK OF GUM,00:00:02.23
HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND,00:00:02.88
THE CITY WAS STILL SLEEPING,00:00:05.04
THAT MAKES SENSE THE OCHIMIST ANSWER,00:00:04.08
THE ARTICLE IN THE CURRENT STATE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUBLICATION,00:00:05.66
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH,00:00:07.99
I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS,00:00:02.71
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE,00:00:05.35
HER WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DARK AND SCARY SKETCHES,00:00:05.40
HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:05.86
BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES,00:00:08.14
ONE THAT WILL WRITE,00:00:02.62
I'M AFRAID IT'LL BE STEVETENA,00:00:03.26
DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE,00:00:05.28
I'VE GOT A DESK I WANT MOVED,00:00:05.98
IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD,00:00:04.97
I DON'T MIND WORKING FROM HOME MOST OF DE TIME BUT I DO MISHAVIN COLD WORKERS,00:00:07.37
THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY,00:00:03.50
THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT,00:00:08.02
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE,00:00:05.42
HE DIDN'T SUDU SO WITH HIS WORDS BUT WITH SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THAT'S THE TRICK,00:00:04.58
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE,00:00:04.49
I'M COMING FATIMER HE SAID,00:00:02.81
I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY SHEEP FASTER,00:00:04.90
WE ARE PART OF THAT SOUL SO WE RARELY RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS WORKING FOR US,00:00:05.66
AND THERE YOU WERE IN BED,00:00:03.98
AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND,00:00:04.08
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCEMY TUT SONAN,00:00:06.26
SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHE IN YARK WAN HE WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE,00:00:04.06
HE WRAMMED THE DWIGS IN A PIECE OF PLOT AND PUGHT THEM BACK IN HIS BAK,00:00:04.94
HIGH  SUPERSITAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE,00:00:03.79
I HAVEN'T WANT MY WINGS YET,00:00:03.14
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT GU,00:00:02.86
WHAT'S THIS THE END OF D EIGH,00:00:03.26
THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING,00:00:05.30
AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION,00:00:05.04
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN,00:00:06.17
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN THEM INTO REALITY,00:00:03.26
HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BROUGHT,00:00:04.30
WHERE ARE WE GOING,00:00:02.06
FOR EVERY TEN MEN DEAD AMONG YOUR ENEMIES YOU'LL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD,00:00:05.42
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS,00:00:04.34
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE,00:00:03.94
I DON'T MIND WORKING FOR HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DOOM MISHAVING CO WORKERS,00:00:07.13
SO YE KNO BAD LOVE THE BOYS SAID,00:00:04.06
ONCE YOU GET FAMILIAR WITH IT YOU WILL WANT TO USE IT FOR EVERYTHING,00:00:06.62
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD,00:00:06.46
TO NOURISH THE FALCON,00:00:04.06
I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK,00:00:02.66
I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF,00:00:04.06
BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS,00:00:03.91
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK,00:00:06.46
YOU HAVE GIVEN UP A SERIOUS CASE OFF MY ONE YOUN,00:00:03.70
BUT THE TRADITION ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERTS,00:00:06.38
IN I CANY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD,00:00:06.72
HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR,00:00:05.69
HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WINDS,00:00:03.14
GOLD WILL LOSE ITS VEIL,00:00:03.31
WEL LIVE TAMARROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALTHEMIST ON EVERY SPON,00:00:04.90
HE HAD NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FAITH,00:00:05.14
THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVEN SUIT CASE FILLED WITH BOOKS,00:00:04.18
BUT HORSES TIRED BIT BY BIT,00:00:02.35
THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY,00:00:05.23
JUST ONE MORE TRY,00:00:02.04
HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE,00:00:02.26
LOVE IS THE FALCIN'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SONS,00:00:04.80
LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL,00:00:04.87
OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT,00:00:03.34
IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE,00:00:06.22
I ALMOST DROPPED HIM,00:00:02.30
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY,00:00:04.22
SO HIS HEART WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON,00:00:03.48
THE RIVER BABBLED NAMELY TO ITSELF,00:00:03.17
THE AIROPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY,00:00:03.50
HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR,00:00:11.98
THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE,00:00:08.86
BUT WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHO GO OUT,00:00:04.46
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND,00:00:05.33
SHE HAS CHIPPED A FINGER NEEL,00:00:02.90
GET A LOAD OF THIS,00:00:01.90
WITHOUT SUCH LOVE ONE'S DREAM WOULD HAVE NO MEANING,00:00:04.10
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION,00:00:10.58
WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD,00:00:02.78
I THOUGHT SURE YOU'D REMEMBER ME,00:00:02.59
HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD,00:00:04.32
YOU MAY KISS MY HAND,00:00:03.94
AS THE SAN ROSE THE MAN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY,00:00:04.10
THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTINE AND THE WARDAS BUILD,00:00:04.94
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID,00:00:03.14
WHERE DO YOU GET IT,00:00:02.18
THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:06.62
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANY ONE WHO SAYS THEY HAVE NEVER HAD HAMBURG OR HILPER,00:00:06.84
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER,00:00:02.81
I'LL HANG IT UP,00:00:02.42
EVERY ONE HAS HIS OR HER ON WAY TO LEARNING THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF,00:00:07.30
THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS,00:00:06.12
HANG ON FOR A SECOND,00:00:03.82
TWO WOMEN WERE STILL MISSING WHEN THE FIRE FIGHTERS ARRIVED,00:00:05.18
DO I KNOW F WHAT,00:00:01.70
EY WHAT DO YOU SAY,00:00:01.94
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET,00:00:04.70
THAT'S WHEN HE O BE SAFE AND NOT A MINUTE BEFORE,00:00:04.08
TWO DAYS LATER TA MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY,00:00:04.80
I AM HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED,00:00:04.82
WHERE IS THAT AERLINE'S BAG,00:00:03.98
THE PINK LOVE HEART KEARING GLOWED,00:00:03.34
TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORREL,00:00:04.70
MANY PEOPLE IN BARKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESACKS MUST HAVE SEEN IT,00:00:04.32
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT,00:00:02.30
THE FORM OF HEAVE STET OUT OF HIS VOTE AWHILE AND UNLAWFULLY,00:00:04.08
THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS,00:00:03.14
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING,00:00:03.14
SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON,00:00:03.38
AND IF IT IS,00:00:02.02
AN FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE,00:00:04.10
I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE,00:00:03.05
THE CHAIR HAD LEATHER UPHOLSTRY,00:00:02.50
ANY STATEMENT OF THE RET APRISING TO MORROW,00:00:03.41
BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THE,00:00:03.34
I'D LIKE TO BUILD A DISPLAY CASE FOR THE CRYSTAL THE BOY SAID TO THE MERCHANT,00:00:05.14
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED,00:00:02.90
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,00:00:03.96
I GOT IT BACK,00:00:03.31
I HAVE TO FIND MEN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,00:00:06.10
WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:06.24
BUT THAT'S THE JAIL,00:00:01.80
MINA DREAMER SAID THE TICKET CELLAR TO HIS ASSISTANT WATTINDEN BOY WALK AWAY,00:00:05.90
HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR,00:00:05.23
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS AT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:04.82
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST PEN WITH A HORSE,00:00:04.75
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE OTHERS,00:00:03.14
I THOUGHT THE AUNTSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC,00:00:04.58
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA,00:00:05.42
I FORGOT MY HEAD,00:00:02.54
WHAT'S MY NAME DOING HONOUR,00:00:03.14
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ATAT T,00:00:03.38
I FEEL SICK WHAT SHOULD I DO,00:00:06.17
IT WAS JUST THEN HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT,00:00:03.14
HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHOR SATE OF THE DUNES,00:00:08.74
I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO,00:00:02.95
BUT SHE IS GONE,00:00:02.76
AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT,00:00:06.10
HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED,00:00:03.74
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM,00:00:03.14
OUGHT BUT A FLESH FOR YOU,00:00:05.28
DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN UNABANDONED CHURCH,00:00:07.68
COACHHAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU,00:00:03.10
THAT'S A PHILOSOPHERS' TONE AND THELIXR OF LIVE,00:00:05.76
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING,00:00:06.77
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN,00:00:04.15
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND,00:00:04.25
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY,00:00:12.38
GIVING PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO CONTAMINATE THE TROOPER,00:00:06.34
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHYMY BUT SAW NONE,00:00:07.18
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND,00:00:03.58
THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF HEAVY GOLD COVERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES,00:00:05.62
IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRIN THAT CAUSED THE MARTIAN'S INCONVENIENCE,00:00:05.88
THEN SHE GOT OUT THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT,00:00:03.46
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY FATHER IS,00:00:03.38
THAT'S ALL I ASK,00:00:01.42
DO YOU KNOW HIM,00:00:01.42
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:02.74
AN I WILL BE THE POLICEMAN,00:00:02.42
DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT,00:00:02.57
THE BOY WENT TO LOOK FOR THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:05.18
THE SHIP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:06.38
IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH,00:00:03.72
I WAS EXPECTING YOU,00:00:02.18
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES,00:00:03.02
THE DESCENT WAS DISTURBINGLY STEEP,00:00:02.59
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO GUISE,00:00:03.10
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT,00:00:02.30
THAT WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MARY HATCH,00:00:04.06
SHE SAT ON THE FLOOR DRINKING HER COFFEE,00:00:03.19
AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL,00:00:10.90
SHE KNOWS THAT MEN HAVE TO GO AWAY IN ORDER TO RETURN,00:00:04.13
OR GILBERT TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN,00:00:03.22
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BACKS LEFT,00:00:02.40
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,00:00:02.09
YOU'LL ASK ME TO WHAT,00:00:02.28
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:03.84
APPARENTLY IS THE DUMPLINGS THAT MAKE THIS DUE TASTE SO GOOD,00:00:03.02
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE,00:00:07.56
SHE'S ACCUSED OF STEALING A WATCH,00:00:03.29
THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON,00:00:02.57
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB,00:00:02.62
FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE ASON DECISIONS,00:00:04.34
HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES,00:00:04.66
HIS HANDS WERE UPRAIDED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HAROT,00:00:07.22
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO HER FROM OUTER SPACE,00:00:05.47
AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:06.02
THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW,00:00:02.54
FOOTPEDALS ARE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS,00:00:07.87
THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF FEAR,00:00:09.38
BUT THE KING OF SALAM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL,00:00:04.87
ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:03.50
AN HUGE HOLE BAT BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PURJETAE A HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PURJECTA,00:00:18.55
WHEN THE BLINDING DUST HAD SETTLED A BIT THE BOY TREMBLED AT WHAT HE SAW,00:00:06.72
THE SECRET IS HERE IN THE PRESENT,00:00:04.94
SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CHEAP COPY BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW,00:00:06.84
I AM LOOKING FOR A TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT,00:00:06.34
I'DN'T KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE,00:00:02.52
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY,00:00:03.14
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:02.81
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY,00:00:03.29
OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAS,00:00:04.39
WHAR IS MY FUNCTION,00:00:05.57
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT,00:00:04.34
NEXT YOU WANT TO ENUMERATE PABS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUMP BETWEEN THEM,00:00:04.58
AND YO'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY,00:00:03.96
IT'S A PRIVATE COB OLD ONLY THE MOST DISCRACABLEN PEOPLE,00:00:06.12
HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED,00:00:03.34
THIS REGARD MELA'S STATEMENT,00:00:02.14
HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME,00:00:04.18
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE AT ANY IDEA ABOUT GASTEMANA,00:00:04.73
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT,00:00:03.86
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA,00:00:05.90
BUT THE MARKET PLESH WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HIREN SO HE WHIPPED,00:00:04.82
THE SHOWERS IN THERE,00:00:02.18
AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS,00:00:04.34
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED,00:00:04.46
I WONDER WHAT'S EATING THAT OLD MUNNEY GRUBBING BUZZARD ANYWAY,00:00:04.22
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OF HER FORM,00:00:04.42
I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE,00:00:02.95
GET A LOAD OF THIS,00:00:01.54
A SYMMETRIC CRIPTOGRAPHY USES PEAIRS OF KEYS,00:00:04.13
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL,00:00:04.51
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME,00:00:03.26
YOU THINK OAS ON THE WITNESS STAND,00:00:02.30
WITH A BAG OF MARSH MALON,00:00:02.02
AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN,00:00:03.65
IF SOME ONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY,00:00:05.28
THE TENLER DIDN'T HOW NOG CHAIN,00:00:02.18
SAMSIN BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENENE MOMENTARILY BLIND,00:00:09.50
I'LL BE BACK THE BOY SAID,00:00:01.85
IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT,00:00:03.38
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW,00:00:07.30
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FATE,00:00:05.06
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FOMELLOER FEATURES,00:00:05.54
BUT THAT I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN,00:00:02.66
EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST,00:00:03.60
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND,00:00:02.90
THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE,00:00:07.49
NO SENSE IN GOING UP THERE,00:00:03.14
IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE A LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING,00:00:05.23
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED,00:00:02.81
THEY HEARD THE SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRE IN THE OCHAS,00:00:07.63
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY,00:00:02.71
HE WANTED TO FORGET WHAT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION,00:00:04.46
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS,00:00:10.58
THERE DEAR IT IS SNART SOMETHING EXCLUSE YOUR HUMANS,00:00:03.70
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID,00:00:05.11
THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PLAY,00:00:06.70
THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL,00:00:02.42
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS,00:00:05.66
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS,00:00:04.37
AFTHER ALL WHO DOESN'T WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES ANDTE CHIEF GREAT HATES,00:00:05.02
STRONG PASSWORDS DON'T HAVE TO BE HARD TO REMEMBER,00:00:06.10
ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION,00:00:03.10
HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP,00:00:02.33
THAT'S WHYY I'M HERE,00:00:02.88
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME N THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS,00:00:05.74
THE BOY SMILED AND CONTINUED DICKIE,00:00:03.50
YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL,00:00:07.01
WHAT KIND OF A PROOF IS THAM,00:00:02.06
EUMENIA DON'T APPROVE OF MY HAVING A BENY,00:00:04.13
IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERTSANS,00:00:04.06
DAT GO OVER THERE LAKES A DRINKALOR TALKALOT BUT DO NOTHING,00:00:03.89
LET'S STOP THIS AND AZA COMMANDER SAID,00:00:04.10
THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS,00:00:07.08
IT CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTERED,00:00:02.28
IT SEEMS OLD AND WISE,00:00:02.78
THE LEAD HAD DRIED INTO THE SHAPE OF THE PAN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER LEAD,00:00:04.70
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS,00:00:08.83
HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SKY FOR A LONG TIME,00:00:03.38
AND HE WAS UNFAIRY MUCH BETTER,00:00:03.02
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS HEANT,00:00:03.98
BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE,00:00:07.03
NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH,00:00:03.02
OGILEE WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP,00:00:04.61
GIVE HER THE WORKS,00:00:02.26
CO THROUGE WITH WHAT,00:00:03.48
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MARES BUT FOUND NOTHING,00:00:04.10
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:03.34
HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE,00:00:03.34
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY,00:00:05.59
I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIORAL INFIXIVE NOT FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS,00:00:04.75
HE WANDED TO FORGET ABOUT DEVISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION,00:00:05.26
GO INTO YOUR DANCE,00:00:02.14
ALTHOUGH SEARCIN AND BINERY SEARCH TREES AS EFFICIENT YOU WON'T FIND ANY FRUITS IN THERE,00:00:06.10
THEY WERE RAISED VOICE AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON,00:00:05.40
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME,00:00:04.66
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT,00:00:04.32
TO NOURISH THE FALCON,00:00:02.78
DAVEA KNOWN AS SIARS AND DAVA HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY,00:00:07.10
TRYING TO IMPERVE THE WORLD BY JUMPING UP AND DOWN,00:00:04.15
MISTER LEIE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW,00:00:02.88
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE,00:00:03.38
JUST LIKE AN ORGAN,00:00:02.30
RAISINGS ARE DELICIOUS,00:00:01.87
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM,00:00:02.09
SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN,00:00:04.27
THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE,00:00:07.82
YOU WANT THE MOON,00:00:02.18
LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAY,00:00:04.66
I AM BEGINNING TO LIKE THIS,00:00:03.22
BUT MOST IMPORTANT HE WAS ABLE EVERY DAY TO LIFT OUT HIS DREAM,00:00:06.82
DRUING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LOAN OF ENGLISH GERMAN I VOLOU ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERY DAY CONVERSATION,00:00:09.98
THE ONE IN THERE,00:00:01.97
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES,00:00:03.55
THE MERCHANT LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY,00:00:02.59
WHERE DID HE KEEP HIS MONEY,00:00:03.19
I LEARNED THE ALCHEMIST'S SECRETS IN MY TRAVEL,00:00:03.74
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON,00:00:03.98
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S'M A CONFOUNDED THING TO YOU,00:00:04.01
THE BOY ONCE STARTLED,00:00:02.71
THREE CHAIRS FOR ADIN CHRISTOPHER,00:00:03.26
AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE,00:00:04.94
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ TCHEHOFF AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HEROINE OF HER OWN STORY,00:00:10.58
ARE YOU ENJOYING LONDON,00:00:02.06
IT PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES,00:00:05.16
HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD,00:00:02.93
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBITTED,00:00:02.76
I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS RAIDING,00:00:04.99
AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY,00:00:04.15
I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,00:00:03.86
THE PECNIC WAS RUINED BY OUR MARCHIN BAN,00:00:02.90
HOW COME YO SPEAK SPANISH HE ASKED,00:00:05.78
DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE,00:00:04.06
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT,00:00:03.70
WHEN THE SEMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN,00:00:05.83
EVERYTHING LOOKED DIFFUSE AFTER SHE TOOK THE NARCOTIC,00:00:04.30
AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YER SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH,00:00:05.78
IF YOU START YOUR FEMALES WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH,00:00:12.60
THE CURSER BLINKED EXPECTANTLY,00:00:03.62
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFUSED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE,00:00:04.97
THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED,00:00:03.22
FRESH COFFEE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE FRIEZE DRIED STUFF,00:00:04.46
I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT,00:00:04.73
THE BOY WAS ALSO SEDEND HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY,00:00:07.10
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME HE SAID TO THE MONK,00:00:05.21
THEY DRANK THEIR MILK AND FELL ASLEEP,00:00:03.86
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY,00:00:03.82
THEY BECOME THE SOUL OF THE LORD,00:00:04.54
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,00:00:02.54
WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN,00:00:06.34
THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID,00:00:05.78
THEY REACHED THE CENTRE OF A LARGE CUAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD,00:00:05.09
HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED,00:00:03.82
NO SENSE MESSING UP THE STREETS,00:00:02.57
I CAN SEE THAT,00:00:01.82
BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC,00:00:04.39
HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS,00:00:03.38
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY,00:00:04.46
JUST HERE THE WINPLE MADE HIM FEEL BETTER,00:00:04.44
THE CITY SEILOR'S OFFICE,00:00:02.74
